Venn diagrams are a way of visualizing sets.
This applet lets you hilight the set A, the set B, the universal set S,
the empty set {}, the complement of A (Ac), the complement of B (Bc),
the intersection of A and B (AB), the union of A and B (A or B),
the intersection of the complement of A with B (AcB), and
the intersection of A with the
complement of B (ABc).
One can think of the relative area of a set to the area of S as a
probability.
You can drag the <a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#event">events</a>
A and B around, which changes the probability of their intersection
and union.
When the probability of the intersection of A and B
equals the product
of the probability of A and the probability of B (when P(AB) = P(A)*P(B)),
A and B are
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#independent">independent</a>.
Notice how hard it is to drag A or B around to make them independent.
The scrollbars let you adjust the probability of A and the probability of
B.
