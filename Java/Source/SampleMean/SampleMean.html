<p>
The <a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#sample_mean">Sample Mean</a>
is the usual average of a
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#random_sample">random sample</a>
 from a population:
it is the sum of the numbers in the sample, divided by the number of numbers in the
sample (the <a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#sample_size">sample size</a>).
The <a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#sample_mean">sample mean</a> is a
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#statistic">statistic</a> that is often
used to estimate the mean of a population.
<p>
The blue <a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#histogram">histogram</a> is the
histogram of a population that contains 5 numbers: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.
When you press the "Take Sample" button, the computer draws a pseudo-random sample
from the population, computes the mean of the sample, and plots the histogram
of the result in green.
As you take more samples, the green histogram will change, showing the distribution
of the results.
The default sample size is 1; because the average of one thing is just that thing,
if you sample repeatedly, you will reproduce the histogram of the population.
This is not terribly interesting.
</p>
<p>
What is interesting is what happens when you increase the
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#sample_size">sample size</a>.
You can change the sample size (the number of numbers in each sample) with
the
"Sample Size" scrollbar. If you increase the sample size, the
variability of the sample
mean will be smaller, and the shape of the green histogram will look more
nearly
normal (as you sample repeatedly).
You can speed things up by taking more than one sample at a time; this is controlled
by the "Samples to Take" scrollbar.
Another scrollbar controls the number of bins in the histogram:
play around with
it to see how the appearance of the plot changes. You will probably get the clearest
impression of the phenomena we are trying to see by using
the maximum number of bins.
</p>
<p>
<b>To Notice:</b>
<ul>
<li>
The average of the sample means gets close to the population mean as you take more
and more samples. This illustrates that the sample mean is an
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#unbiased">unbiased</a>
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#estimator">estimator</a> of the
population mean.
<li>
The variability (as measured by the standard error or
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#se">SE</a>) of the sample
mean is smaller for larger sample sizes.
It shrinks like the square-root of the sample size.
This is an illustration of the
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#square_root_law">Square-root Law</a>.
</li>
<li>
If the sample size is large, the histogram of the sample mean approaches
the <a href="../Teach/S2/gloss.xht#normal_curve">normal curve</a> as you take more
samples, even though the histogram of
the population isn't even vaguely shaped like a normal curve.
(Click the "Show Normal Curve" button to superpose the corresponding
normal curve.)
This is an illustration of the
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#clt">Central Limit Theorem</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 align=center>More Detail</h2>
<p>The sample mean of a random sample from a population
is an estimator of the mean of the population.
The sample mean is a random variable, because its value depends on
what the particular random sample happens to be.
The expected value of the sample mean is the population mean, and the
standard error (SE) of the sample mean is the SD of the population, divided
by the square-root of the sample size.
</p>
<p>
This applet lets you type a population of number into a box, then look at
how the histogram of values of the sample mean evolves as you take more and
more samples. There are slider controls for the sample size and the number of
samples to take each time the "Take Sample" button is pushed, as well
as a slider to control the bin width in the histogram.
</p>
<p>
If the sample size is sufficiently large, the sampling distribution of the
sample mean, converted to standard units, follows the Normal Curve approximately.
A button in the applet lets you superpose the theoretical Normal Curve with
the histogram of observed values of the sample mean. Two sliders let you
hilight part of the histogram, and compare the area of that part of the histogram
with the area of the same part of the Normal Curve.
For large sample size, the areas should become close as you take more and
more samples of that fixed large size.
</p>
<p>
To get started, press the "Clear Box" button, then type the numbers you
wish to be in the population into the box, separated by spaces and/or on
separate lines.
Then push the "Replace Box Contents" button.
You will see a blue histogram of the population of numbers you typed into the
box.
</p>
<p>
Press the "Take Sample" button a few times, using the default sample size
of one.
You will see a histogram of sample values emerge in green.
As you take more and more samples, the green histogram should get closer
and closer to the blue one: the sample mean of a random sample of size one
has the same distribution as the population.
Move the slider for "Samples to Take" up to its maximum, and press the
"Take Sample" button a few times. The green and blue histograms should
match pretty well.
</P>
<p>
Now slide the "Samples to Take" control back to one, and slide the
"Sample Size" control to a moderate number, say 50.
This will clear the green histogram.
Every time you press the "Take Sample" button now, you are computing the
sample mean of a random sample of size 50 from the population of numbers
you put into the box.
The green histogram that emerges as you take more and more
samples will be more concentrated near the
population mean than the blue histogram is. The values of the sample mean
are more finely divided than the values in the population, as well.
Move the "Samples to Take" slider back up to its maximum, and
press the "Take Sample" button a few more times.
As you take more and more samples, the mean of the
green histogram that emerges will tend to be closer and closer to the
mean of the population. The spread of the histogram, measured by its SD,
will be about the SD of the population, divided by the square-root of 50
(about 7).
Press the "Show Normal" button. The green histogram should follow
the normal curve pretty well. You can compare areas under the histogram with
the corresponding areas under the normal curve with the "Hilight From: "
and "To: " sliders.
</p>
<p>
Now move the sample size up to 200, the maximum on the slider, and move the
"Samples to Take" slider back to 1.
The green histogram will clear again.
Take a few samples of size 200 from your population.
The values of the sample mean will be even more finely divided than before,
and will tend to be even closer to the population mean.
Slide the "Samples to Take" control up to a large value, and press the
"Take Sample" button a few times. The green histogram should follow the
normal curve very well.
It should "balance" quite close to the population mean, and its width
should be about the SD of the population, divided by about 14
(the square-root of 200).

This applet illustrates several important statistical concepts:
<ol>
<li>
The <a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#sample_mean">sample mean</a>
 of a
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#simple_random_sample">simple random
sample</a> is an
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#unbiased">unbiased</a>
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#estimator">estimator</a> of the
population mean.
</li>
<li>
The SD of the sample mean shrinks in proportion to the square-root of the
sample size (the
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#square_root_law">Square-Root Law</a>).
</li>
<li>
The distribution of the sample mean is nearly normal, for large enough samples,
no matter what the distribution of the population is (the
<a href="../Teach/S2/Notes/gloss.xht#clt">Central Limit
Theorem</a>).
</li>
</ol>
