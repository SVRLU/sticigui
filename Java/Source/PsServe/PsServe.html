<p align="left">Your browser must be configured to accept cookies to use
SticiGui<sup>&copt;</sup> Problem Sets.
SticiGui<sup>©</sup> problem sets combine forms, instructions, and
interactive graphics, to reinforce the material presented in the chapters. The problem
sets use two <em>frames</em>. The upper frame has the instructions and a form for your
responses; the bottom frame has tools you might need to solve the problems. </p>

<p align="left">At the beginning of each problem set, in the upper frame, you are asked
for the following identifying information: </p>

<p align="center">last name, first name, email, SticiGui<sup>©</sup> identification
number, SticiGui<sup>©</sup> password.</p>

<p align="left">In
Microsoft Internet Explorer, use the tab key to move between fields to enter your answers.
In Netscape, you can use either the tab key or the return key. In Internet Explorer, if
you use the return key, that will start to submit your answers, even if you are not done with the
problem set. (Don't worry, you can cancel the submission.)</p>

<p align="left">At the bottom of the instruction frame, after all the questions, there are
three buttons: one to submit the problem set for grading, one to save your intermediate
results on your computer, and one to clear the answer form. <strong>Your
must press the submit button to send your answers to be graded.</strong>
You will get confirmation in this window of your browser that your problem set was
received by the server, and additional confirmation
by email (if you entered your email address correctly).
After the date on which the problem set is due, your score will be posted to the
<a href="../index.htm" target="_top">SticiGui<sup>©</sup> website</a>. <a
href="../Grades/query.htm" target="glossWin">To query your grades</a>, you need your
SticiGui<sup>©</sup> identification number and password, to protect your privacy.</p>

<p align="left">You can save intermediate results on the problem set using a button at the
bottom of the instruction page. The problem sets also save themselves on your computer
when you submit them, if you have your browser configured to accept cookies.&nbsp; That
lets you resubmit the same answers again in case, for some reason, your submission does
not get to the server. To use the save feature, you must use the same computer every time you
work on a given problem set. You can use different computers for different problem sets.
After filling out the identifying information at the top of this page to access the
problem sets, the computer will look for a record of your previous work on the problem
set. If it finds your previous work, the problem set will have your previous answers
filled in.  If it does not find your previous work, it will generate new questions,
and the answer fields will be blank.</p>

<h3 align="center"><blink><font color="#FF0000">Warning</font></blink></h3>

<p>Many of the problem sets are generated randomly. The correct answers are computed to
correspond to those problems and data. <font color="#FF0000"><strong>You should not go to
the glossary or follow any other links from a Problem Set page---that will change the
problems and/or the data</strong>. </font><font color="#000000"> Some of your answers that
were previously correct could become incorrect for the new problems.</font> Instead, use a
different browser window, or open a new window. Similarly, if you reload or re-visit the
problem set, some of the problems will be different, unless you use the &quot;save&quot;
feature described above, and are working from the same computer each time.
<font color="#000000">On unix machines and PCs, you can
right-click on a link to get a drop-down menu that lets you open the link into a new
window; that will not affect your problem set.</font></p>
