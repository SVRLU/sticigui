   You need Java to see this.

<p>

Venn diagrams are a way of visualizing sets.

This applet lets you highlight the set A, the set B, the universal set S,

the empty set {}, the complement of A (Ac), the complement of B (Bc),

the intersection of A and B (AB), the union of A and B (A or B),

the intersection of the complement of A with B (AcB), and

the intersection of A with the

complement of B (ABc).

One can think of the relative area of a set to the area of S as a

probability.

The picture uses that analogy: the numbers P(A) and P(B) are proportional to

the area of A and the area of B, respectively; P(AB) is the area of the

intersection of A and B, and P(A or B) is the area of the union of A and B.

</p>

<p>

You can drag the <a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#event">events</a>

A and B around, which changes the probability of their intersection

and of their union.

When A and B do not overlap, they are said to be

<a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#disjoint">disjoint or mutually exclusive</a>.

When the probability of the intersection of A and B

equals the product

of the probability of A and the probability of B (when P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B)),

A and B are

<a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#independent">independent</a>.

Try to drag A or B to make P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B);

notice how hard it is to make the overlap just

right: independence is a very special relationship between events.

The scrollbars let you adjust the probability of A and the probability of

B.
