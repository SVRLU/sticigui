<p>

    The <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_sum">sample

    sum</a> is the sum of a <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#random_sample">random

    sample</a> from a population. The <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample

    mean</a> is the usual average of a <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#random_sample">random

    sample</a> from a population: it is the sample sum, divided by

    the number of numbers in the sample (the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_size">sample

    size</a>). The <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample

    mean</a> is a <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#statistic">statistic</a>

    that is often used to estimate the mean of a population.

</p>



<p>

    The blue <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>

    shows the distribution of the numbers in the box on the right,

    which initially contains the five numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. When

    you press the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button, the computer draws

    a pseudo-random sample with replacement from the population,

    computes the sum or mean of the sample, and plots the histogram

    of the result in green. As you take more samples, the green

    histogram will evolve, showing the distribution of the results.

    The value of the sample sum or sample mean is random, because it

    depends on the random sample. It is not the same every time a

    sample is drawn. The default sample size is 1. Because the

    average of one number is just that number, if you sample

    repeatedly, you will reproduce the histogram of the population.

    This is not terribly interesting.

</p>



<p>

    What is more interesting is what happens when you increase the

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_size">sample

    size</a>. You can change the sample size (the number of numbers

    in each sample) by typing a different number into the box labeled

    &quot;Sample Size,&quot; then striking the &quot;enter&quot; or

    &quot;return&quot; key. If you increase the sample size, the

    variability of the sample mean will be smaller, and the shape of

    the green histogram will look more nearly normal (as you sample

    repeatedly). You can speed things up by taking more than one

    sample at a time; this is controlled by the &quot;Take _____

    samples&quot; box. Another box controls the number of bins in the

    histograms. You will probably get the clearest impression of the

    phenomena we are trying to see by using the maximum number of

    bins.

</p>



<p><b>To Notice:</b> </p>



<ul>

    <li>The average of the sample means gets close to the

    population mean as you take more and more samples. This

    illustrates that the sample mean is an <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#unbiased">unbiased</a>

    <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#estimator">estimator</a>

    of the population mean. </li>

    <li>The variability (as measured by the standard error or <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#se">SE</a>) of

    the sample mean is smaller for larger sample sizes. It

    shrinks like the square-root of the sample size. This is

    an illustration of the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#square_root_law">Square-root

    Law</a>. </li>

    <li>If the sample size is large, the histogram of the sample

    mean and sample sum approach the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#normal_curve">normal

    curve</a> as you take more samples, even though the

    histogram of the population isn't even vaguely shaped

    like a normal curve. (Click the &quot;Show Normal

    Curve&quot; button to superpose the corresponding normal

    curve.) This is an illustration of the <a

    More Detail

</h2>



<p>

    The sample mean of a random sample from a population is an

    estimator of the mean of the population. The sample mean is a

    random variable, because its value depends on what the particular

    random sample happens to be. The <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#expectation">expected

    value</a> of the sample sum is the sample size times the

    population mean (the average of the numbers in the box). The

    standard error (<a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#se">SE</a>)

    of the sample sum is the square-root of the sample size, times

    the <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">standard

    deviation</a> (SD) of the numbers in the box. The expected value

    of the sample mean is the population mean, and the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#se">SE</a> of the

    sample mean is the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> of the

    population, divided by the square-root of the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_size">sample

    size</a>.

</p>



<p>

    This applet lets you type a population of numbers into a box,

    then look at how the histogram of sample values of the sample

    mean evolves as you take more and more samples. There are

    controls for the sample size and the number of samples to take

    each time the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button is pushed, as well

    as a control for the number of bins in the histogram.

</p>



<p>

    If the sample size is sufficiently large, the histogram of the

    sampling distribution of the sample sum and sample mean,

    converted to standard units, follow the <a

    href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#normal_curve">normal

    curve</a> approximately. A button in the applet lets you

    superpose the theoretical normal curve with the histogram of

    observed values of the sample sum or mean. Two controls

    (&quot;Highlight from&quot; and &quot;to&quot;) let you highlight

    part of the histogram, and compare the area of that part of the

    histogram with the area of the same part of the normal curve. For

    large sample size, the areas should become close as you take more

    and more samples of that fixed large size.

</p>



<p>

    To replace the contents of the box, delete the numbers in the

    box, type in the numbers you want, then click anywhere outside

    the box. You should then see a blue histogram of the population

    of numbers you typed into the box.

</p>



<p>

    Press the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button a few times, using

    the default sample size of one. You will see a histogram of

    sample values emerge in green. As you take more and more samples,

    the green histogram should get closer and closer to the blue one:

    the sample mean of a random sample of size one has the same

    distribution as the population. Increase the number of samples to

    take to 100 by typing into the corresponding box (&quot;Take ____

    samples&quot;) and striking the &quot;enter&quot; or

    &quot;return&quot; key. Press the &quot;Take Sample&quot; button

    a few times. The green and blue histograms should match pretty

    well---the observed sampling of samples of size one converges to

    the distribution of values of the population.

</p>



<p>

    Now change the &quot;Take ____ samples&quot; control back to

    one, and change the &quot;Sample Size&quot; to 50. This will

    clear the green histogram. Every time you press the &quot;Take

    Sample&quot; button now, you are computing the sample mean of a

    random sample of size 50 from the population of numbers you put

    into the box. The green histogram that evolves as you take more

    and more samples will be concentrated nearer the population mean

    than the blue histogram is. The values of the sample mean are

    more finely divided than the values in the population, as well.

    Change the &quot;Samples to Take&quot; to 100, and press the

    &quot;Take Sample&quot; button a few more times. As you take more

    and more samples, the mean of the green histogram that emerges

    will tend to be closer and closer to the mean of the population.

    The spread of the histogram, measured by its SE, will be about

    the SD of the population, divided by the square-root of 50 (about

    7). Press the &quot;Show Normal Curve&quot; button. The green

    histogram should follow the normal curve pretty well. You can

    compare areas under the histogram with the corresponding areas

    under the normal curve with the &quot;Highlight from&quot; and

    &quot;to&quot; controls.

</p>



<p>

    Now move the sample size up to 200, the maximum on the slider,

    and move the &quot;Samples to Take&quot; slider back to 1. The

    green histogram will clear again. Take a few samples of size 200

    from your population. The values of the sample mean will be even

    more finely divided than before, and will tend to be even closer

    to the population mean. Slide the &quot;Samples to Take&quot;

    control up to a large value, and press the &quot;Take

    Sample&quot; button a few times. The green histogram should

    follow the normal curve very well. It should &quot;balance&quot;

    quite close to the population mean, and its width should be about

    the SD of the population, divided by about 14 (the square-root of

    200).

</p>



<p>

    This applet illustrates several important statistical

    concepts:

</p>



<ol>

    <li>

        The <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#sample_mean">sample

        mean</a> of a <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#simple_random_sample">simple

        random sample</a> is an <a

        <a href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#estimator">estimator</a>

        of the population mean.

    </li>

    <li>

        The SD of the sample mean shrinks in proportion to the

        square-root of the sample size (the <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#square_root_law">Square-Root

        Law</a>).

    </li>

    <li>

        The distribution of the sample mean is nearly normal, for

        large enough samples, no matter what the distribution of

        the population is (the <a

        href="../../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#clt">Central

        Limit Theorem</a>).

<p>

    The choice box in

    the title area lets you select either the sample mean or the

    sample sum. Every time you press the &quot;Take Sample&quot;

    button in the title area, samples with replacement are drawn from

    the population of numbers in the box at the right hand side, and

    either the sum or mean of each sample is taken, corresponding to

    whichever is visible in the title. The &quot;Sample Size&quot;

    box controls how large each sample is, and the &quot;Take ____

    samples&quot; box controls how many samples of that size are

    taken each time you press the &quot;Take sample&quot; button. The

    mean and SD of the numbers in the box are displayed on the left,

    along with the SE of the sample mean or sample sum (corresponding

    to whichever is selected), and the number of sample valuesand

    histograms of the numbers in the box and of the sample values of

    the sample mean or sum are shown in the middle, in blue and

    green, respectively. You can superpose the normal curve on the

    histogram of sample values by clicking the &quot;Show Normal

    Curve&quot; button.

</p>



<p>

    The

    &quot;Highlight from&quot; and &quot;To&quot; boxes let you

    highlight a range of sample values in the histogram; the area of

    the highlighted range of sample values (the proportion of values

    of the sample mean or sample sum in the range) is then displayed,

    along with the corresponding area under the normal curve, if the

    normal curve is showing. When you switch between the sample sum

    and the sample mean, the &quot;Highlight from&quot; and

    &quot;To&quot; limits are transformed to correspond to the

    equivalent range of sample values. The &quot;Bins&quot; box

    controls the number of bins in the histograms. If you change the

    sample size, the history of sample values will be reset and green

    histogram will clear (you cannot mix sample sizes in the same

    plot). Changing the number of samples to take does not clear the

    history, nor does toggling back and forth between the sample sum

    and the sample mean.

</p>



<p>

    To change the

    numbers in the population box, either delete the numbers in the

    box using the backspace key and type in new values, or selecting

    the numbers in the box and type over them. Then click outside the

    population box to update the values. The display of the Ave(box),

    SD(box) and SE(mean) or SE(sum) (depending on which is displayed)

    will be updated to reflect the new contents of the box.

</p>



<p>

    To change the

    number in the &quot;Highlight From,&quot; &quot;To,&quot;

    &quot;Sample Size,&quot; &quot;Take ____ Samples,&quot; or

    &quot;Bins&quot; box, delete or select and type over the current

    number, then strike the &quot;enter&quot; or &quot;return&quot;

    key. The &quot;Highlight From&quot; and &quot;To&quot; values can

    also be changed using the neighboring scrollbars.
