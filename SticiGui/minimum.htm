<p>
	SticiGui requires an up-to-date standards-compliant browser.
	I recommend <a href="www.mozilla.org">Mozilla Firefox</a> 18.0 or higher.
        Current versions of <a href="www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a> and
        <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> work with most of the materials.
	The materials do not work reliably with Microsoft Internet Explorer.
</p>

<p>In summary, you need:

<ul>
  <li>Internet access, for example, either through an account specifically for
    this class, another university account, a commercial internet service provider (ISP), a
    public or university library, <em>etc. </em>If your connection to the network is slower
    than 28.8Kbps, some of the demonstrations and labs with large datasets can take quite a
    while to start up (several minutes), but once they are running, they should run
    smoothly.
  </li>
  <li>An up-to-date web browser that supports HTML 4.01, frames, cookies,
    cascading style sheets, and JavaScript 1.8.
    <strong>SticiGui will not work correctly with older versions of browsers.
    Some problems will not be apparent except when you submit an assignment, so beware!</strong>
    If you are misgraded because you are using an out-of-date browser, your instructor might
    not be sympathetic.
</p>

<p>
    Not all features work reliably with Microsoft Internet Explorer; moreover, Internet
    Explorer is a security risk to you, so I recommend that you not use it for anything.
    You need to make sure that Java and JavaScript are &quot;enabled&quot;
    in your browser, not just that the software supports Java and JavaScript.
    How to enable Java, JavaScript, and cookies depends on
    which browser you
    use; see the documentation or help for your browser.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    <strong>Not only must your browser support Java and JavaScript, but
    both must be enabled.</strong>
