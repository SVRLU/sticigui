    <a id="introduction"></a>Statistics
</h1>

<p>
    Statistics is the science of drawing conclusions from data.
    This chapter introduces a rough taxonomy of data, as well as tools for
    presenting,
    summarizing, and displaying data: tables, frequency tables, histograms,
    and percentiles.
    The tools are
    illustrated using datasets from trade secret litigation and geophysics.
</p>

<h2><a id="data"></a>
     Data
</h2>

<p>
     In its broadest sense, Statistics is the science of
     drawing conclusions about the world from data.
     Data are observations (measurements) of
     some quantity or quality of something in the world.
     &quot;Data&quot; is a plural noun; the singular form is &quot;datum.&quot;
     Our lives are filled with data: the weather, weights,
     prices, our state of health, exam grades, bank balances, election results, and so on.
     Data come in many forms, most of which are numbers, or can be translated into numbers for
     analysis.
     In this chapter, we will see several types of data, and tools for summarizing
     data.
</p>

<p>
     There are several important questions to keep in mind when you
     evaluate quantitative evidence:
</p>

<ul>
     <li>
        Are the data relevant to the question asked?
     </li>
     <li>
        Was the data collection fair, or might there have been some
        conscious or unconscious <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bias">bias</a> that
        influenced the results or made some cases less likely to be observed?
     </li>
     <li>
        Do the data make sense?
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     The answers to these questions are crucial to drawing conclusions
     from data.
</p>

<div class="example">
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--
   var qStr = 'Data of little relevance.';
   writeExampleCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>
<p>
	Trident&reg; sugarless gum used to advertise that &quot;4 out of 5 dentists
	surveyed recommend Trident&reg; sugarless gum for their patients who chew gum.&quot;
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
	Such a survey says little about whether Trident&reg; gum is better for your
	teeth than other gum, with or without sugar.
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--
   var fStr = 'Other issues, such as how the dentists were selected, what questions were asked, ' +
              'how missing data were treated, etc., may also lead to biased or unreliable results. ' +
              'These issues are discussed in later chapters.';
   writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr, fStr);
// -->
</script>
	It would be more relevant to study the effect on teeth of chewing
	different kinds of gum, not the opinions of dentists who might not have
	conducted (or even read) any empirical research on the effects of different
	kinds of gum.
</p>
<p></p>
</div>

	Course evaluation forms often ask students questions about the effectiveness of
	the instructor.
	At UC Berkeley, many students are absent from class when evaluation forms are

	the evaluation form data will tend to be biased: on average, the forms will tend to
	report that the instructor is more effective than students really think he really is.

<h3>
    <a id="variables"></a>Variables
</h3>

<p>
  A <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#variable">variable</a> is a value
  or characteristic that can differ from individual to individual.
  Data are generally recorded values of variables.
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#quantitative">Quantitative variables</a>
  take numerical values whose &quot;size&quot; is meaningful.
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#quantitative">Quantitative</a> variables answer questions such as
  &quot;how many?&quot; or &quot;how much?&quot;
  For example, it makes sense to add, to subtract, and to
  compare two persons' weights, or two families' incomes:
  These are quantitative variables.
  Quantitative
  variables typically have measurement units, such as pounds, dollars, years, volts,
  gallons, megabytes, inches, degrees, miles per hour, pounds per square inch, BTUs, and
  so on.
</p>

<p>
  Some <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#variable">variables</a>, such as social
  security numbers and zip codes, take numerical values, but are not
  quantitative:
  They are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#qualitative">qualitative</a> or
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#categorical">categorical</a> variables.
  The sum of two zip codes or social security numbers is not meaningful.
  The average of a list of zip codes is not meaningful.
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#qualitative">Qualitative</a> and
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#categorical">categorical</a> variables typically do not have units.
  Qualitative or categorical variables&mdash;such as gender, hair
  color, or ethnicity&mdash;group individuals.
  Qualitative and categorical variables have neither a &quot;size&quot; nor, typically,
  a natural ordering to their values.
  They answer questions such as &quot;which kind?&quot;
  The values categorical and qualitative variables take are typically adjectives
  (for example, green, female, or tall).
  Arithmetic
  with <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#qualitative">qualitative</a> variables usually does not
  make sense, even if the variables take numerical values.
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#categorical">Categorical</a>
  variables divide individuals into categories, such as gender, ethnicity, age group, or
  whether or not the individual finished high school.

<p>
     The distinction between these types of variables is
     somewhat blurry.
     For example, we might group ages into categories such as under 5 years
     old, between 5 and 15, between 15 and 25, between 25 and 40, and over 40.
     Similarly,
     whether gender or climate types are qualitative or categorical variables is not clear-cut.
     Generally, if there is an implicit ordering of the values the variable can take (hot is
     warmer than warm, which is warmer than cold), there is a tendency to call a variable
     qualitative rather than categorical; some people call such variables
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#ordinal">ordinal</a>.
     It is common to <em>code</em>
     categorical and qualitative variables using numbers, for example, 1 for male and 0 for
     female.
     <em><strong>The fact that a category is labeled with a number does not make the
     variable quantitative!</strong></em>
     The real issue is whether arithmetic
     with the values makes sense.
</p>

<p>
  Individuals need not be people; for example, we might be
  comparing microclimates in the San Francisco Bay Area, using variables such as
</p>

<ul>
     <li>annual rainfall in inches (quantitative)</li>
     <li>annual number of sunny days (quantitative, discrete)</li>
     <li>A classification into &quot;very foggy,&quot; &quot;somewhat
     foggy,&quot; and &quot;sunny.&quot; (qualitative, ordinal)</li>
     <li>annual average temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. (quantitative)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Similarly, the &quot;individuals&quot; could be a single
  &quot;individual&quot; at different times:
  A variable might be the price of a share of
  Microsoft stock at different times.
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    It is sometimes useful to divide
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#quantitative">quantitative</a> variables further into
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#discrete">discrete</a> and
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#continuous">continuous</a>
    variables. (This division is sometimes rather artificial.)
    The set of possible values of a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#discrete">discrete</a> variable is
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#countable">countable</a>.
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--
     var fStr = 'A set is <em>countable</em> if it can be put in one-to-one ' +
       'correspondence with a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#subset">subset</a> ' +
       'of the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, &hellip;';
     writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr, fStr);
// -->
</script>
    Examples of discrete variables include ages measured to the
    nearest year, the number of people in a family, and stock prices on the
    New York Stock Exchange.
    In the first two of these examples, the
    variable can take only some positive integers as values.
    In all three examples, there is a
    minimum spacing between the possible values.
    Most discrete variables are like this&mdash;they
    are &quot;chunky.&quot;
    Variables that count things are always discrete.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    Examples of continuous variables include things like the exact
    ages or heights of individuals, the exact temperature of something, <em>etc</em>.
    There is
    no minimum spacing between the possible values of a continuous variable.
    The possible
    values of discrete variables don't necessarily have a minimum spacing.
    (For example, the set of fractions&mdash;rational numbers&mdash;is
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#countable">countable</a>,
    but there is no minimum spacing between fractions.)
    One reason the distinction between
    discrete and continuous variables is somewhat vague is that in practice there is always
    a limit to the precision with which we can measure any variable.
    The limit depends on the instrument
    we use to make the measurement, how much time we take to make the measurement,
    and so on.
    For most purposes, the distinction between continuous and discrete variables
    is not important.

     The following exercise checks your understanding of the differences
     among types of variables.
     The exercise will tell you immediately whether you are right or wrong:
     Each question is followed by an image.
     Initially, the image is a question mark.
     If you answer the question correctly, the question mark is replaced by a
     check mark.
     If you answer the question incorrectly, the question mark is replaced by an X.
     Once you attempt the exercise, you can see the correct answer by clicking the image.
     Clicking the image again will hide the answer.
     Clicking the [+Solution] link (when there is one) reveals a more detailed answer.

</h4>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WWAvdTjW13A?start=50&end=449" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
    The first data set is the Trade Secret Data, which
    arose from a lawsuit alleging the theft of a customer list.
    The names of the people and firms have been changed, but otherwise,
    the facts are stated as I understand them.
</p>

<p>
   On 1 May 1995, two former employees of WeeBee Hardware (WBH), a firm that sells
   computer components to computer assemblers and retailers, opened the doors of a new
   company, Weasel Drives (WD).
   One of the former employees had worked at WBH up
   to the day before WD opened its doors; the other had stopped working for WBH
   about 18 months previously.
   Both firms are in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.
</p>

<p>
   From the time WD started business, it sold essentially the same kinds of computer
   components that WBH did, mostly to former customers of one of the former employees, at
   essentially the same prices and with essentially the same credit terms. Indeed, in the
   first two days WD was in business, one of the former employees had called the top dozen
   of her WBH accounts.
   In its first month of business, WD sold about $1 million of equipment to
   former customers of WBH; that amount increased to about $2&nbsp;million per
   month in the course of a few months.
</p>

<p>
   The principals of WBH sought an injunction against WD to prevent it from selling to
   customers of WBH, alleging that their customer list was a trade secret and had been
   misappropriated by its former employees.
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--
   var fStr = 'A further complication is that <em>another</em> former employee of WBH ' +
              'and arch-rival of the principals of WBH apparently set up WD\'s business, ' +
              'including renting facilities for them, financing their startup, and advancing ' +
              'about $400,000 of inventory to them without collateral.';
   writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr, fStr);
// -->
</script>
</p>

<p>
    It is well established that a customer list can qualify as a trade secret: It has
    economic value, and derives its value from not being generally known.
    Customer lists can be the product of years of soliciting new business by advertising and
    &quot;cold-calling&quot; tens of
    thousands of potential customers and winnowing that list down to a few hundred
    or a few thousand who actually do buy the kind of equipment the firm sells, who will buy
    it from that firm, and who pay promptly.
    With knowledge of a firm's list of customers, a competitor could avoid the time and expense of
    some advertising, cold-calling, checking credit
    references, bad debt, and so on.
</p>
<p>
   In response to WBH's request for an injunction, WD asserted:
</p>

<ul>
     <li>
       They found the names of the customers in public sources,
       such as CD-ROMs that contain lists of businesses, and from
       computer magazines in which those customers advertise, <em>not</em>
       from their knowledge of WBH's customers.
     </li>
     <li>
       Such a large overlap with WBH's customer list was inevitable,
       because WBH had so many customers.
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
   A California Court of Appeals decision (<u>ABBA Rubber Co. v. Seaquist</u> 286
   Cal. Rptr. at 528) establishes that a &quot;readily ascertainable by proper
   means&quot; affirmative defense to a claim of misappropriation is appropriate under
   certain circumstances:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
    [I]f the defendants can convince the finder of fact &hellip;
    (1) that it is a virtual
    certainty that anyone who manufactures certain types of products uses rubber rollers,
    (2) that the manufacturers of those products are easily identifiable, and (3) that the
    defendants' knowledge of the plaintiff's customers <strong><u>resulted from
    that identification process and not from the plaintiff's records</u></strong>,
    then the defendants may establish a defense to the misappropriation
    claim.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
    <u>ABBA Rubber Co.</u>, 286 Cal. Rptr. at 529, ftnt. 9.
</p>
<p>
    WD would thus be in the clear if they could show that they identified
    the customers they called from the CD-ROMs and/or magazines without
    using their knowledge of WBH's customer list.
    I was retained as an expert witness to calculate the probability that
    certain subsets of WD customers would overlap with analogous subsets
    of the active WBH customer list to the extent that they do, and that
    WD would place as large a number of calls to WBH customers as they did,
    under various assumptions.
    The plaintiff's law firm matched the defendants' customer list against the
    plaintiff's, and against advertisements in the magazines from which WD claimed
    they obtained most of their customers.
    The plaintiff agreed (stipulated) that essentially all the names in
    question were in the CD-ROMs.
    The plaintiff's law firm also went through the defendants'
    telephone records and identified calls to WBH customers and others.
    Only local toll calls and long distance calls result in telephone records,
    so calls to WBH customers who are close to WD could not be identified.
</p>

<p>
    WBH had 3310 active customers at the time in question; WD had 132.
    They had 93 customers in common.
    WD claimed to have found the names of 27 of their customers in local
    trade magazine advertisements, and to have found the names of 31 of their customers in
    the CD-ROMs.
    A total of 469 potential buyers of the kind of equipment WD sells advertised
    in the magazines in question; 152 of them were WBH customers.
    Of the 27 customers WD claimed to have found in the magazines, 26 were customers of WBH.
    Of the 31 customers WD claimed to have found in the CD-ROMs, 22 were customers of WBH.
    Of the 3310 WBH customers, 1769 were outside the San Francisco Bay Area.
    Of the 132 WD customers, 8 were outside the San Francisco Bay Area.
    All 8 of the WD customers outside the Bay Area were also customers of WBH.
    Other experts estimated that there were more than 90,000 potential buyers of the kinds of
    equipment WBH and WD sell in the U.S. as a whole, and more than 60,000 outside the San
    Francisco Bay Area (including Silicon Valley).
    There were 2906 WBH customers to whom calls
    by WD would have resulted in phone records, and 68 WD customers for whom there were phone
    records, of whom 53 were customers of WBH.
    In the month of May, 1995, WD placed a total of
    1050 calls that produced phone records, and 1006 of them were to the 53 customers of WBH.

<p>
   The second set of data is a collection of measurements of <span class="math">g</span>,
   the acceleration due to gravity, made at Pi&ntilde;on Flat Observatory in 1989 (day 229, between
   5:29:52pm and 5:48:08pm).
   You might remember from a physics class that if you drop an
   object, it falls faster and faster (it accelerates), until it hits the ground.
   The rate at which it would accelerate, in the absence of air resistance, is <span class="math">g</span>.
   At Earth's
   surface, <span class="math">g</span> is about 9.8 meters per second per second (m/s<sup>2</sup>).
   That is, each second an object falls, it gains about 9.8 meters per second of speed.
   A meter per second (m/s) is about 2.24 miles per hour (mph), so the acceleration
   due to Earth's gravity is about
</p>

<p class="math">
    (9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)&times;(2.24 mph/(m/s)) = 22 miles per hour
     per second.
</p>
<p>
    If you go bungee jumping from high enough that you
    fall for 2 seconds before the bungee starts to stretch, you will be going about
</p>

<p class="math">
    (22 miles per hour per second)&times;(2 seconds) = 44
     miles per hour.
</p>
<p>
    This calculation neglects air resistance, which would slow you down a bit.
</p>

<p>
    The table lists the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#deviation">deviations</a> of the 100
    measurements from a base value of 9.792838 m/s<sup>2</sup>, times 10<sup>8</sup>.
    That is, each entry in the table is
</p>

<p class="math">
    100,000,000&times;(measured value of <span class="math">g</span> in m/s<sup>2</sup>
  &minus;9.792838).
</p>

<p>
    (Note that 10<sup>8</sup> =
     10&times;10&times;10&times;10&times;10&times;10&times;10&times;10 =
    100,000,000. If you need to review exponential notation,
    see <a href="../Problems/index.htm" target="_self">Assignment</a> 1.)
</p>

<p>
    The experimental apparatus used to collect these data is pretty slick:
    It uses a laser and an accurate time
    reference to determine the distance a mirrored corner of a cube falls in a vacuum chamber
    as a function of time.
    The cube is dropped in a vacuum to avoid air resistance, which
    would make the measurements systematically too small.
    These measurements were made at Pi&ntilde;on Flat Observatory by Glen
    Sasagawa and Mark Zumberge of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
    California.
    Tiny fluctuations in gravity, like those this instrument can measure, allow
    geophysicists to learn about the distribution of mass within the Earth,
    about movements of the Earth associated with the tides,
    and with stresses that lead to earthquakes.

<p>
    Here, the tabular representation does not mean anything special; it is
    just a way of writing a list.
</p>

<p>
   A reasonable mathematical model for the observations is that
</p>

<p class="math">
    (observed value of <span class="math">g</span>) = (true value of <span class="math">g</span>)
     + error,
</p>

<p>
    where the error tends to be different for each measurement.
</p>

<p>
    Why make so many measurements?
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
     To increase accuracy: Errors in different measurements tend to average out to some extent,
     so one can estimate <span class="math">g</span> better using an average of a large number of measurements
     than one can using a single measurement.
    </li>
    <li>
     To assess uncertainty: The variability of the repeated measurements gives an
     estimate of the uncertainty of a single measurement, or of the average of
     the measurements.
    </li>
    <li>
     To monitor the experiment: If the fluctuations get larger, or a measurement is
    &quot;unusual,&quot; something might be going wrong with the experiment.
    </li>
</ul>

    In later chapters, we will illustrate the first and second points using these data.

</p>

<p>
    It is hard to learn much by looking at this list;
    it would be helpful to summarize the values in a more transparent way.
    We shall begin by constructing a
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#frequency_table">frequency table</a>.
    A <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#frequency_table">frequency table</a>
    lists the frequency (number) or
    relative frequency (fraction) of observations that fall in various ranges,
    called &quot;<a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class intervals</a>.&quot;
    We also need an
    &quot;<a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#endpoint_convention">endpoint convention</a>&quot;
    to be able to construct
    a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#frequency_table">frequency table</a>:
    If an observation falls on the
    boundary between two <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class intervals</a>, in which
    class interval do we count the observation?
    The two standard choices are always to include
    the left boundary and exclude the right, except for the rightmost class interval, or
    always to include the right boundary and exclude the left, except for the
    leftmost class interval.
</p>

<p>
    Let us construct a relative frequency table for the gravity data.
    There are no
    hard-and-fast rules for determining appropriate
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class
    intervals</a>, and the impression one gets of how the data are distributed depends on the
    number and location of the intervals (more on this later in this chapter).
    We shall use the following nine class intervals:
</p>

<div align="center">
<center>
    <ul class="noBullet">
       <li>&minus;160 (inclusive) to &minus;110 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>&minus;110 (exclusive) to &minus;90 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>&minus;90 (exclusive) to &minus;70 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>&minus;70 (exclusive) to &minus;40 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>&minus;40 (exclusive) to &minus;10 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>&minus;10 (exclusive) to 20 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>20 (exclusive) to 50 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>50 (exclusive) to 80 (inclusive)</li>
       <li>80 (exclusive) to 160 (inclusive)</li>
     </ul>
</center></div>

<p>
    Note that the endpoint convention here is always to include the right
    boundary and exclude the left, except for the leftmost class interval.
    To construct the frequency table, the next step is to count the number
    of data that fall in each <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class
    interval</a>.
    Counting is much easier if we sort the data.

<p>
    Ten is 10% of 100, so the relative frequency of
    observations in the second class interval is 10%.
    The last class interval contains the two observations {150, 155}.
    Two is 2% of 100, so the relative frequency of observations in

<p>
  The frequency table is easier to interpret than the raw data, but it is
  still hard to get an overall impression of the data from it.
  The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a> is an
  excellent tool for studying the
  distribution of a list of quantitative measurements.
  A <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>
  is a way of visualizing a frequency table graphically&mdash;of making a picture from a
  frequency table.
  The fraction of data in each class interval is represented by a rectangle
  (<a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bin">bin</a>) whose base is the class interval
  and whose area is the
  fraction of data (relative frequency of data) that fall in the class interval:

<p>
    The key to a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a> is that it is
    the <em>area</em> of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bin">bin</a>, not the height
    of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bin">bin</a>, that represents the relative frequency of data
    in the bin.
    The area of the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bin">bin</a> is proportional to the relative
    frequency of observations in
    the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class interval</a>.
    The horizontal axis of a histogram needs a scale with units.
    The vertical axis of a histogram always has units of percent per
    unit of the horizontal axis, so that the areas of bins have units of
</p>

<p class="math">
    (horizontal units) &times; (percent per horizontal unit) =
    percent.
</p>
<p>
  The scale of the vertical axis is automatically
  imposed by the fact that the total area of the
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>
  must be 100% (100% of the data fall somewhere on the plot).
  The vertical scale is called a
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#density">density scale</a>.
  The height of a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bin">bin</a>
  is the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#density" target="glossWin">density</a> of
  observations in the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bin">bin</a>: the percentage of observations
  in the bin per unit of the
  horizontal axis.
  Typically it is <em>not</em> the percentage of observations in the bin.
</p>

<p>
     A <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a> is not the same as
     a <em>bar chart</em>: In a bar chart, the height of a rectangle (bar), rather
     than the area of the bar, indicates the relative frequency of observations.
     The width of the bar does not matter; it does not even need to have units.
     This makes bar charts especially useful for displaying
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#categorical" target="glossWin">categorical</a> and
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#qualitative" target="glossWin">qualitative</a> data,
     where the horizontal axis does not have a scale&mdash;it is just a way to separate
     groups.
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">Histograms</a> are more appropriate for
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#quantitative" target="glossWin">quantitative</a> data.
</p>

<p>
     For the gravity data, the first
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class interval</a> is from &minus;160 to
     &minus;110, and has 9% of the data.
     The height of the corresponding <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bin">bin</a> is thus

     (The unit is 10<sup>&minus;8</sup>m/s<sup>2</sup>.)
</p>

<p>
     The second class interval has width (&minus;90 &minus; (&minus;110)) = 20
     units, and has 10% of the observations, so the height of the
     corresponding bin is

</center></div>

<p>
     The last class interval has width 160&minus;80 = 80 units,
     and has 2% of the observations, so the height of the last bin is
</p>

<div align="center"><center>

     <tr>
     <td align="center">80 units</td>
     <td></td>
     <td></td>
     </tr>
</table>
</center></div>
<p>
    The height of the last bin is one twentieth (.025/.5)
    that of the second bin.
</p>

<p>
     The relative frequency of observations in the second class interval is five
     times that of the last class interval (10% versus 2%), so the area of the second bin is
     five times that of the last bin.
     The width of the second class interval is 1/4 the width
     of the last class interval (&minus;90&minus;(&minus;110) = 20, versus 160&minus;80 = 80; 20 is 1/4 of 80).
     Thus the second bin is 5&times;4=20 times taller than the last bin.

</p>

<p>
     The word &quot;<a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#distribution">distribution</a>&quot;
     refers to how numerical data are &quot;distributed&quot; on the real line.
     We can discover qualitative features of the
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#distribution">distribution</a> of the data from the
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>.
     The &quot;center&quot; of the data is around &minus;50 to &minus;40.
     Most of the observations are between &minus;110 and 20.
     The observations are not distributed
     <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#symmetric_distribution">symmetrically</a> around the
     center: They continue farther to the right of the center than to the left of the center.
     The distribution is said to be <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#skewed">skewed</a> to the right,
     <em>right-skewed</em> or to have a <em>long right tail</em>.
     Conversely, when the data are more spread out to the left of the
     &quot;center&quot; than to the right, the distribution is said to be
     <em><a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#skewed">skewed</a> to the
     left</em>, <em>left-skewed,</em> or to have a <em>long left tail</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Distributions of prices and incomes tend to be skewed to the right.
  For example, consider house prices. Most homes cost under $100,000 to $200,000
  (depending on the locality), but a relatively small number of homes sell for tens of
  millions of dollars. Similarly, most family annual incomes are under $60,000, but a small
  number of people have annual incomes exceeding tens of millions of dollars. Age distributions
  also tend to be skewed to the right; for example, there is unlikely to be anyone in this
  class younger than 14 years old, and most are between 17 and 22, but a few &quot;returning
  students&quot; are likely to be in their 30s, 40s or older.
</p>

<p>
  This histogram of the gravity data consists of only one &quot;bump:&quot; it is
  said to be <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#unimodal">unimodal</a>. In general, a
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a> is said to be
  <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#multimodal">multimodal</a> if it has more than one bump, and
  in particular <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bimodal">bimodal</a> if it has two bumps.

</p>

<p>
    Another way to characterize a list of numbers is using
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#percentile">percentiles</a>.
    The <em>p</em>th percentile of a list is the
    smallest number that is at least as large as <em>p</em>% of the numbers in the list.
    For example, 10% of the gravity data are less than or equal to &minus;108, so &minus;108
    is the 10th percentile of the gravity data.
    The smallest number that is at least as large as 13% of
    the data is &minus;106, so &minus;106 is the 13th percentile of the data,
    even though in fact 15% of the observations are less than or equal to &minus;106.
    The 13th through 15th percentiles of these data are all &minus;106.
    <em>It is much easier to find
    percentiles from the sorted list than from the original!</em>
</p>

<p>
    Some percentiles have special names, as shown in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--
     var qStr = 'Table&nbsp;' + cNum + '-' + tCtr.toString() + '. ';
     document.writeln(qStr);
// -->
</script>
</p>

<div align="center">
<center>
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"> <!--
     var qStr = 'Common named percentiles.';
     writeTableCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>

    <table class="dataTable">
     <tr>
   <th id="col0">Percentile</th>
   <th id="col1">Special Name</th>
   <th id="col2">Abbreviation</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
   <td headers="col0">25th</td>
   <td headers="col1">Lower Quartile</td>
   <td headers="col3">LQ</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
   <td headers="col0">50th</td>
   <td headers="col1">Median</td>
   <td headers="col3">M or MED</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
   <td headers="col0">75th</td>
   <td headers="col1">Upper Quartile</td>
   <td headers="col3">UQ</td>
     </tr>
    </table>
</center></div>

<p>
    The lower quartile is the 25th percentile: the smallest number that is at least as
    large as 25% of the data.
    The median is the 50th percentile: the smallest number that is at least as
    large as half the data.
    We just saw that the median of the gravity data is &minus;47.
    The upper quartile is the 75th percentile: the smallest number that is at least
    as large as 75% of the data.
    Approximately half the observations are between the lower quartile and the upper quartile.
</p>

    The following exercises verify that you can calculate percentiles.

<p>
    To find a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#percentile">percentile</a> of a
    set of measurements exactly, one needs the original data.
    In plotting a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>, the data are grouped into
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class intervals</a>, which typically
    makes it impossible to find exact <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#percentile">percentiles</a>
    from a histogram.
    A histogram tells you the percentage of data each class interval contains, but not where in the class
    interval each datum is.
    However, one can find <em>approximate</em>
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#percentile">percentiles</a>
    from a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>: The <em>p</em>th
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#percentile">percentile</a>
    is approximately the point on the horizontal axis such that
    the area under the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a> to the left of the
    point is <em>p</em>%.

    is another histogram of the Pi&ntilde;on Flat <span class="math">g</span> data, with
    equal-width class intervals:

<p>
    This histogram has equal-width <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class intervals</a>.
    You can change the number of bins by typing a different value into the box labeled
    &quot;Bins&quot; and
    pressing the Return or Enter key&mdash;but don't do that yet.
    If you click the List Data button, a new
    window will pop up with a listing of the 100 numbers in the gravity data set.
    This applet also
    displays two numbers that are defined in
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('location') + ': ');
// -->
</script>
    the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#mean">mean</a>
    (average) and the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#sd">SD</a> (standard deviation).
    The range &minus;152 to &minus;44.2 is highlighted when you first
    open this page, and the figure shows that the area under the histogram in that range is 50%.
    Our estimate of the median from the histogram thus  would be &minus;44.2.
    We saw earlier in this chapter that the median of the data is &minus;47:
    The estimate of the median from the histogram is off by a bit
    because the data have been grouped into
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class intervals</a> in the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#histogram">histogram</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Type &minus;47 into the <span class="appCtrlName">to</span> box, and press Return or Enter.
    The selected area under the histogram should show 48%.
    The difference between 48% and 50% is also caused by the grouping of data into
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#class_interval">class intervals</a> in the histogram.
</p>

<p>
     The following exercise lets you practice estimating percentiles from histograms.
</p>

<!-- ==================================START PROBLEM==================================== -->
<div class="problem">
<script language="JavaScript1.4" type="text/javascript"><!--
     document.writeln(startProblem(pCtr++));
    var qStr = '<span class="qSpan">Estimate the following percentiles of the gravity data ' +
      'from the histogram:</span></p><div align="center"><center>' +
      '<table class="dataTable"><tr>' +
      '<th id="col0">Percentile</td><th id="col1">Estimate from histogram</td>' +
      '</tr><tr><td headers="col0">25th</td><td headers="col1">';
    document.writeln(qStr);
    writeTextExercise(8,qCtr++,'-79.6:-79.4');
    var qStr = '</td></tr><tr><td headers="col0">60th</td><td headers="col1">';
    document.writeln(qStr);
    writeTextExercise(8,qCtr++,'-30.6:-30.4');
    var qStr = '</td></tr><tr><td headers="col0">90th</td><td headers="col1">';
    document.writeln(qStr);
    writeTextExercise(8,qCtr++,'18.4:18.8');
    var qStr = '</td></tr></table></center></div>';
    document.writeln(qStr);
    var ansStr = 'The area under the histogram between &minus;160 and &minus;79.5 ' +
    ' is 25%, so &minus;79.5 is the estimate of the lower quartile (25th ' +
    ' percentile) from the histogram. The area under the histogram ' +
    ' between &minus;160 and &minus;30.5 is 60%, so &minus;30.5 is the estimate of the ' +
    ' 60th percentile from the histogram. The area under the histogram ' +
    ' between &minus;160 and 18.5 is 90%, so 18.5 is the estimate of the 90th ' +
    ' percentile from the histogram. ';
    writeSolution(pCtr-1, ansStr);
// -->
</script>
</div>

<p>
    Now change the number of bins from 9 to 30 by typing 30 into
    the <span class="appCtrlName">Bins</span> box and pressing Return or Enter.
    The histogram is now rougher&mdash;it has more &quot;bumps&quot; or modes.
    The appearance of a histogram depends crucially on how the class intervals are chosen.
    If you estimate percentiles from the histogram with 30 bins and with 9 bins,
    you will get different answers.

<h2><a id="summary"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>
     This chapter introduced <em>variables</em>, and distinctions among variables, according to the
     kinds of values the variables can take: <em>quantitative</em>,
     <em>qualitative</em>, and <em>categorical</em>.
     Quantitative variables are classified further as either <em>discrete</em> or
     <em>continuous</em>.
     Data&mdash;observed values of variables&mdash;can be presented in many ways.
     Tables often are easier to understand than words.
     When the number of data is large, looking at the data provides little insight,
     but summaries of the data can help.
     Quantitative data can be summarized using <em>frequency tables</em>.
     Constructing a frequency table requires specifying <em>class intervals</em> and an
     <em>endpoint convention</em>.
     Frequency tables can be presented graphically as <em>histograms</em>, which give an
     impression of the distribution of the data.
     In a histogram, relative frequency is represented by area.
     Characteristics of the distribution that can be gleaned from a histogram include
     <em>symmetry</em>, <em>skewness</em>, and the number and location of <em>modes</em>.
     However, the appearance of those characteristics in a histogram depends on
     the number and location of the class intervals.
     <em>Percentiles</em> are another way to summarize the distribution of a list.
     Calculating percentiles exactly requires the original data, but percentiles
     can be estimated approximately from histograms.
