    reviewed the basic tool needed to discuss probability
    mathematically, Set Theory.
    This chapter introduces the mathematical theory of probability,
    in which probability is a function that assigns numbers between
    0 and 100% to <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#event">events</a>, subsets of
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#outcome_space">outcome space</a>.
    Starting with just three axioms and a few definitions, the mathematical
    theory develops powerful and beautiful consequences.
    The chapter presents the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#axioms_of_probability">axioms of probability</a>
    and some consequences of the axioms.
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#conditional_probability">Conditional probability</a>
    is then defined, which leads to two useful
    formulae&mdash;the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#multiplication_rule">Multiplication Rule</a>
    and <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#bayes_rule">Bayes' Rule</a>&mdash;and to the

    The Axioms of Probability
</h2>

</p>

<p>
    The <span class="termOfArt">axioms of probability</span> are mathematical rules that probability must satisfy.
    Let <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> be events.
    Let <span class="math">P(A)</span> denote the probability of the event <span class="math">A</span>.
    The axioms of probability are these three conditions on the function <span class="math">P</span>:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The probability of every event is at least zero.
        (For every event <span class="math">A</span>, <span class="math">P(A) &ge; 0</span>.
        There is no such thing as a negative probability.)
    </li>
    <li>
        The probability of the entire outcome space is 100%.
        (<span class="math">P(<strong>S</strong>) = 100%</span>.
        The chance that <em>something</em> in the outcome space occurs is 100%,
        because the outcome space contains every possible outcome.)
    </li>
    <li>
        If two events are <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#disjoint">disjoint</a>, the
        probability that either of the events happens is the sum of the
        probabilities that each happens.
        (If <span class="math">AB = {}</span>,
        <span class="math">P(A &cup; B) =
        P(A) + P(B)</span>.)
    </li>
</ol>

    In place of axiom 3, the following axiom sometimes is used:

    3') If <span class="math">{A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>,

    Both axiom 3 and axiom 3' hold for every probability function used in
    this book.
    Any function <span class="math">P</span> that assigns numbers to subsets of the outcome space
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> and satisfies the Axioms of Probability is called a
    <em>probability distribution on</em> <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.

    The function # is called the <span class="termOfArt">cardinality function</span> and

    Then the function <span class="math">P</span> is called
    <span class="termOfArt">the uniform probability distribution on</span>
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.
    The function <span class="math">P</span> satisfies the axioms of probability.
    Let us see why.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The number of elements in any subset <span class="math">A</span> of
            <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is at least
            zero (<span class="math">#A&ge;0</span>), so <span class="math">P(A) &ge; 0/n = 0</span>.
            Thus <span class="math">P</span> satisfies Axiom 1.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <span class="math">P(<strong>S</strong>) =
             #<strong>S</strong>/n = n/n = 100%</span>.
            Thus <span class="math">P</span> satisfies Axiom 2.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            If <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are disjoint,
            then the number of elements in the
            union <span class="math">A&cup;B</span>
            is the number of elements in <span class="math">A</span> plus the number
            of elements in <span class="math">B</span>:
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            #(A&cup;B)
            = #A + #B.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore,
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            P(A&cup;B) =
            #(A&cup;B)/n =
            (#A + #B)/n = #A/n +
            #B/n = P(A)

<p>
    We shall use the uniform probability distribution very often.
    For example, we shall use the uniform probability distribution on
    the outcome space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong> = {0, 1}</span> to model the number of heads in a
    single toss of a fair coin.
    We shall use the uniform probability distribution on the outcome
    space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong> =  {1, 2, &hellip; , 6}</span> to model the number of spots that
    show on the top face of a fair die when it is rolled.
    We shall use the uniform probability distribution on the outcome
    space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> of the 36 pairs
</p>

<p class="math">
    {(i, j):  i = 1, 2, &hellip; , 6 and j = 1, 2, &hellip; , 6}
</p>

<p>
    to model rolls of a fair pair of dice.
    We shall use the uniform probability distribution on the outcome
    space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> of all 52! permutations of a deck of cards to model
    shuffling the deck well.
    We shall use the uniform probability distribution to model
    drawing a ticket from a well-stirred box of numbered tickets;
    in that case, the outcome space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is the collection
    of numbers written on the tickets (including duplicates
    as often as they occur on the tickets).
    The uniform probability distribution is the same as the
    distribution postulated by the
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#theories_of_probability">Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes</a>
    (if the outcomes are defined suitably).
</p>

<div class="example">

<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"> <!--
    var qStr = 'The Probability Distribution for a Single Trial.';
    writeExampleCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>

<p>
    Consider a random trial that can result in failure or success.
    Let 0 stand for failure, and let 1 stand for success.
    Then we can consider the outcome space to be <span class="math"><strong>S</strong> = {0, 1}</span>.
    For any number <span class="math">p</span> between 0 and 100%, define the
    function <span class="math">P</span> as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="math">P({1}) = p</span>,
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="math">P({0}) = 100% &minus; p</span>,
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="math">P(<strong>S</strong>) = 100%</span>,
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="math">P({}) = 0</span>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Then <span class="math">P</span> is a probability distribution on
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>, as we can verify
    by checking that it satisfies the axioms:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Because <span class="math">p</span> is between 0 and 100%, so is
          <span class="math">100% &minus; p</span>.
        The outcome space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> has but four subsets:
         <span class="math">{}, {0}, {1}</span>, and <span class="math">{0, 1}</span>.
        The values assigned to them by <span class="math">P</span> are
        <span class="math">0, 1 &minus; p, p,</span> and <span class="math">100%</span>,
        respectively.
        All these numbers are at zero or larger, so <span class="math">P</span> satisfies Axiom 1.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>By definition, <span class="math">P(<strong>S</strong>) = 100%</span>, so
           <span class="math">P</span> satisfies Axiom 2.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The empty set and any other set are disjoint, and it is easy to
            see that
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            P({}&cup;A) =
            P({}) + P(A) for any subset A of <strong>S</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only other pair of disjoint events in <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>
            is <span class="math">{0}</span> and <span class="math">{1}</span>.
            We can calculate
        </p>
        <p class="math">
            P({0}&cup;{1}) = P(<strong>S</strong>)
            = 100% = (100% &minus; p) + p = P({0}) + P({1}).
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus <span class="math">P</span> satisfies Axiom 3.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    In later chapters this probability distribution will be the building
    block for more complex distributions involving sequences of trials.

<h2><a id="consequences"></a>Consequences of the Axioms of Probability</h2>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    Everything that is mathematically true of probability is a consequence
    of the Axioms of Probability, and of further definitions.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"> <!--
    var fStr = 'Well, almost. There are subtleties regarding the probability of ' +
           'infinite unions of events and the possibility that <span class="math">P</span> cannot assign ' +

           'space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> has a finite number of elements (as it does in ' +
           'most applications in this book), these complications do not arise.';
    writeFootnote(fCtr++, fCtr, fStr);
// -->
</script>
    For example, if <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#countable">countable</a>&mdash;that is,
    if its elements can be put into 1:1 correspondence with a subset of the
    integers&mdash;the sum of the probabilities of the elements of
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> must be 100%.
    This follows from Axioms 2 and 3': Axiom 3' tells us that because the
    elements of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#partition">partition</a> <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>, the
    probability of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is the sum of the probabilities
    of the elements of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>. Axiom 2 tells us that that sum must be 100%.

<h3>
   <a id="complement_rule"></a>The Complement Rule
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6LwpGO7nrP8?start=1810&end=2102" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
    Another consequence of the axioms is the Complement Rule: The probability
    that an event occurs is always equal to 100% minus the probability
    that the event does not occur:
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A<sup>c</sup>) = 100% &minus; P(A).
</p>

<p>
    The Complement Rule is extremely useful, because in many problems
    it is much easier to calculate the probability that <span class="math">A</span> does not
    occur than to calculate the probability that <span class="math">A</span> does occur.
    The complement rule can be derived from the axioms: the union of <span class="math">A</span>
    and its complement <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span> is
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>
    (either <span class="math">A</span> happens or it does not,
    and there is no other possibility), so
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A&cup;A<sup>c</sup>)
    = P(<strong>S</strong>) = 100%,
</p>

<p>
    by axiom 2.
    The event <span class="math">A</span> and its complement are disjoint (if
    &quot;<span class="math">A</span> does not happen&quot; happens,
    <span class="math">A</span> does not happen;
    if <span class="math">A</span> happens, &quot;<span class="math">A</span>
    does not happen&quot; does not happen), so
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A&cup;A<sup>c</sup>) =
    P(A) + P(A<sup>c</sup>)
</p>

<p>
    by axiom 3.
    Putting these together, we get
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A) + P(A<sup>c</sup>) = 100%.
</p>

<p>
    Subtracting <span class="math">P(A)</span> from both sides of this equation yields
    what we sought:
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A<sup>c</sup>) = 100%-P(A).

    Consider tossing a fair coin 10 times in such a manner that every
    sequence of 10 heads and/or tails is equally likely.
    What is the probability that the coin lands heads at least once?
</p>

<p>
    This would be quite difficult to calculate directly, because there
    are very many ways in which the coin can land heads at least once.
    However, there is only one way the coin can fail to land heads at least once:
    All the tosses must yield tails.
    That makes it easy to calculate the probability that the coin lands
    heads at least once, using the Complement Rule.
</p>

<p>
    Every sequence of heads and tails is equally likely, by assumption:
    The probability distribution is the uniform distribution on sequences
    of 10 heads and/or tails, so the probability of any particular
    sequence is 100%/(total number of sequences).
    By the <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#fundamental_rule_of_counting">Fundamental Rule of Counting</a>,
    there are
</p>

<p class="math">
        2&times;2&times; &hellip; &times;2 = 2<sup>10</sup> = 1,024
</p>

<p>
    sequences of 10 heads and tails.
</p>

<p>
    One of those sequences is (tails, tails, &hellip; , tails), so the probability that
    the coin lands tails in all 10 tosses is
</p>

<p class="math">
    100%/2<sup>10</sup> = 0.0977%.
</p>

<p>
    By the complement rule, the probability that the coin lands heads at
    least once is therefore
</p>

<p class="math">
      100% &minus; 0.0977% = 99.902%</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    A special case of the Complement Rule is that the probability of the empty set
    is always zero <span class="math">(P({}) = 0%)</span>,  because
    <span class="math">P(<strong>S</strong>) = 100%</span>, and
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong><sup>c</sup>= {}</span>.
</p>

<p>
    An event <span class="math">A</span> whose probability is 100% is said to be

    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is certain.

<h3>
   <a id="union_rule"></a>The Probability of the Union of Two Events
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6LwpGO7nrP8?start=2102&end=2595" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>
    The third Axiom of Probability tells us how to find the probability of a
    union of disjoint events in terms of their individual probabilities.
    The Axioms can be used together to find a formula for the probability
    of a union of two events that are not necessarily disjoint in
    terms of the probability of each of the events and the probability of
    their intersection.
</p>

<p>
    The union of two events, <span class="math">A&cup;B</span>,
    can be <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#partition">partitioned</a> into three
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#disjoint">disjoint</a> sets:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Elements of <span class="math">A</span> that are not in <span class="math">B</span>
        (<span class="math">AB<sup>c</sup></span>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Elements of <span class="math">B</span> that are not in <span class="math">A</span>
        (<span class="math">A<sup>c</sup>B</span>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Elements of both <span class="math">A</span> and
        <span class="math">B</span> (<span class="math">AB</span>)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Together, these three disjoint sets contain every element of
    <span class="math">A&cup;B</span>:
</p>

<p class="math">
    A&cup;B =
    AB<sup>c</sup> &cup;
    A<sup>c</sup>B
    &cup; AB.
</p>

<p>
    That is, the three sets <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#partition">partition</a>
    <span class="math">A&cup;B</span>.
    The third axiom implies that the chance that either
    <span class="math">A</span> or <span class="math">B</span> occurs is
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A&cup;B)
    = P(AB<sup>c</sup>) + P(A<sup>c</sup>B)
    + P(AB).
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand,
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A) = P(AB<sup>c</sup>
    &cup; AB) =
    P(AB<sup>c</sup>) + P(AB),
</p>

<p>
    because <span class="math">AB<sup>c</sup></span> and <span class="math">AB</span> are disjoint.
    Similarly,
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(B) = P(A<sup>c</sup>B
    &cup; AB) =
    P(A<sup>c</sup>B) + P(AB),
</p>

<p>
    because <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup>B</span> and <span class="math">AB</span> are disjoint.
    Adding, we find that
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A) + P(B) = P(AB<sup>c</sup>) +
    P(A<sup>c</sup>B) +2&times;P(AB).
</p>

<p>
    This would be equal to <span class="math">P(A&cup;B)</span>,
    but for the fact that <span class="math">P(AB)</span> is
    counted twice, not once.
    It follows that in general
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A&cup;B) =
    P(A) + P(B) &minus; P(AB).
</p>

<p>
    This is a true statement, but it is not one of the axioms of probability.
    In the special case that <span class="math">AB = {}</span>, this result is equivalent to
    the third axiom, because  <span class="math">P({}) = 0%</span>.
</p>

    Probability is analogous to area or volume or mass.
    Consider the unit square, each of whose sides has length 1.
    Its total area is <span class="math">1&times;1 = 1 = 100%</span>.
    Let's call the square <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>, just like outcome space.
    Now consider regions inside the square <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>
    (<a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#subset">subsets</a>
    of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>).
    The area of any such region is at least zero, the area of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is
    100%, and the area of the union of two regions is the sum of
    their areas, if they do not overlap (i.e., if they are
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#disjoint">disjoint</a>).
    These facts are direct analogues of the axioms of probability,
    and we shall often use this model to get intuition about probability.
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"> <!--
    var fStr = 'This is an example of the uniform distribution on an uncountable ' +
           'set: The probability of a subset <span class="math">A</span> of ' +

           '<span class="math">area(A)/area(<strong>S</strong>)</span>. ' +

<p>
    It might help your intuition to consider the square <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> to be a
    dartboard.
    The experiment consists of throwing a dart at the board once.
    The event <span class="math">A</span> occurs if the dart sticks in the set <span class="math">A</span>.
    The event <span class="math">AB</span> occurs if the dart sticks in both
    <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> on that one toss.
    Clearly, <span class="math">AB</span> cannot occur unless <span class="math">A</span> and
    <span class="math">B</span> overlap&mdash;the
    dart cannot stick in two places at once.
    <span class="math">A&cup;B</span> occurs if the dart
    sticks in either <span class="math">A</span> or <span class="math">B</span> (or both) on that
    one throw.
    <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> need not overlap for
    <span class="math">A&cup;B</span> to occur.
</p>

<p>
    This analogy is also useful for thinking about the connection between
    Set Theory and logical implication.
    If <span class="math">A</span> is a subset of <span class="math">B</span>, the
    occurrence of <span class="math">A</span>
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#implies">implies</a>
    the occurrence of <span class="math">B</span>; We shall sometimes say that <span class="math">A</span>
    implies <span class="math">B</span>.
    In the dartboard model, the dart cannot stick in <span class="math">A</span>
    without sticking in <span class="math">B</span> as well, so if
    <span class="math">A</span> occurs, <span class="math">B</span> must occur also.
    If <span class="math">A</span> implies <span class="math">B</span>, <span class="math">AB=A</span>,
    so <span class="math">P(AB)=P(A)</span>.
    If <span class="math">AB = {}</span>,
    <span class="math">A</span> implies <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup></span> and
    <span class="math">B</span> implies <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span>: If the dart sticks
    in <span class="math">A</span> it did not stick in <span class="math">B</span>, and vice versa.
    If <span class="math">A</span> implies <span class="math">B</span>,
    then if <span class="math">B</span> does not occur <span class="math">A</span> cannot
    occur either:
    <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup></span> implies <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span>,
    so <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup></span> is a subset of <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span>.

<h2><a id="conditioning"></a>Conditioning</h2>

<p>
    In probability, <em>conditioning</em> means incorporating new

    updating probabilities to take into account new information.

    probability can be used to solve complicated problems.

    Conditional Probability

</p>

<p>
    The conditional probability of <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span>,
    <span class="math">P(A | B)</span>,
    is the probability of the
    event <span class="math">A</span>, updated on the basis of the knowledge that the event <span class="math">B</span>
    occurred.
    Suppose that <span class="math">AB = {}</span>
    (<span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are disjoint).
    Then if we learn that <span class="math">B</span> occurred, we know <span class="math">A</span> did not occur,
    so we should revise the probability of <span class="math">A</span> to be zero
    (the conditional probability of <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span> is zero).
    On the other hand, suppose that <span class="math">AB = B</span>
    (<span class="math">B</span> is a subset of <span class="math">A</span>, so <span class="math">B</span> implies <span class="math">A</span>).
    Then if we learn that <span class="math">B</span> occurred, we know <span class="math">A</span> must have
    occurred as well, so we should revise the probability of
    <span class="math">A</span> to be 100% (the conditional probability of <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span> is 100%).
    For in-between cases, the conditional probability of <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span>
    is defined to be
</p>

<div align="center">
<center>
    <table>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td align="center"><span class="math">P(AB)</span></td>
    </tr>
        <tr>

        <td></td>
        <td align="center"><span class="math">P(B)</span></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</center>
</div>

<p>
    provided <span class="math">P(B)</span> is not zero (division by zero is undefined).
    &quot;<span class="math">P(A | B)</span>&quot; is pronounced &quot;the
    (conditional) probability of <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span>.&quot;
</p>

<p>
    Why does this formula make sense?
    First of all, note that it does agree with the intuitive answers we
    found above: if <span class="math">AB = {}</span>, then
    <span class="math">P(AB) = 0</span>, so
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A | B)
    = 0/P(B) = 0;
</p>

<p>
    and if <span class="math">AB = B</span>,
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A | B) = P(B)/P(B) = 100%.
</p>

<p>
    Similarly, if we learned that <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> occurred, this is not really new
    information (by definition, <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> always occurs, because it
    contains all possible outcomes), so we would like
    <span class="math">P(A | <strong>S</strong>)</span> to equal <span class="math">P(A)</span>.
    That is how it works out:
    <span class="math">A<<strong>S</strong> = A</span>, so
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A | <strong>S</strong>) = P(A)/P(<strong>S</strong>) =
    P(A)/100% = P(A).
</p>

<p>
    Now suppose that <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are not disjoint.
    Then if we learn that <span class="math">B</span> occurred, we can restrict attention
    to just those outcomes that are in <span class="math">B</span>, and disregard the
    rest of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>, so we have a new outcome space that is just <span class="math">B</span>.
    We need P(B) = 100% to consider <span class="math">B</span> an outcome space; we
    can make this happen by dividing all probabilities by <span class="math">P(B)</span>.
    For <span class="math">A</span> to have occurred in addition to
    <span class="math">B</span> requires that <span class="math">AB</span> occurred,
    so the conditional probability of <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span> is
    <span class="math">P(AB)/P(B)</span>,
    just as we defined it above.
</p>

<div class="example">

<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"> <!--

</script>


<p>
    We shall deal two cards from a well shuffled deck.
    What is the conditional probability that the second card is an Ace
    (event <span class="math">A</span>), given that the first card is an Ace (event <span class="math">B</span>)?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>.
    By definition, this is <span class="math">P(AB)/P(B)</span>.
    The (unconditional) chance that the first card is an Ace
    is 100%/13 = 7.7%, because there are 13 possible
    faces for the first card, and all are equally likely
    (this is what we mean by a well well-shuffled deck).
</p>

<p>
    The chance that both cards are Aces can be computed as follows:
    From the four suits, we need to pick two; there are <sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = 6 ways
    that can happen.
    The total number of ways of picking two cards from the deck is
    <sub>52</sub>C<sub>2</sub> = 52&times;51/2 = 1326, so the chance that the two cards are
    both Aces is (6/1326)&times;100% = 0.5%.
    The conditional probability that the second card is an
    Ace given that the first card is an Ace is thus
    0.5%/7.7% = 5.9%.
    As we might expect, it is somewhat lower than the chance that the
    first card is an Ace, because we know one of the Aces is gone.
</p>

<p>
    We could approach this more intuitively as well: Given that
    the first card is an Ace, the second card is an Ace too if it is one of
    the three remaining Aces among the 51 remaining cards.
    These possibilities are equally likely if the deck was shuffled well,
    so the chance is 3/51 &times; 100% = 5.9%.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    Conditional probability behaves just like probability:
    It satisfies the axioms of probability and all their consequences.
    Thus, for example,
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="math">P(A | B) &ge; 0</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="math">P(B | B) = 100%</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="math">P(A&cup;C | B)
          = P(A | B)  + P(C | B)</span> if
         <span class="math">ABC = {}</span>.
    </li>
    <li><span class="math">P(A<sup>c</sup> | B) =
         100% &minus; P(A | B)</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="math">P({} | B) = 0</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="math">P(A&cup;C | B) =
          P(A | B)  + P(C | B) &minus;
          P(AC | B)</span>.

    Independence
</h3>

<p class="video"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6LwpGO7nrP8?start=4182&end=4858" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>

<p>Two events are <span class="termOfArt">independent</span> if learning that one occurred gives us
    no information about whether the other occurred.
    That is, <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are independent
    if <span class="math">P(A | B) = P(A)</span> and
    <span class="math">P(B | A) = P(B)</span>.
    A slightly more general way to write this is that
    <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are independent
    if <span class="math">P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B)</span>.
    (This covers the cases that <span class="math">P(A)</span>,
    <span class="math">P(B)</span> or both are equal to zero,
    while the definition of independence in terms of conditional probability requires the
    probability in the denominator to be different from zero.)
    To reiterate: Two events are independent if and only if the probability
    that both events happen simultaneously is the product of their
    unconditional probabilities.
    If two events are not independent, they are <span class="termOfArt">dependent</span>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Independence and Mutual Exclusivity Are Different!</strong>
    In fact, the only way two events can be both
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#disjoint">mutually exclusive</a> and
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#independent">independent</a> is if at least one of them has probability equal to zero.
    If <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>  are mutually exclusive,
    learning that <span class="math">B</span> happened
    tells us that <span class="math">A</span> did not happen.
    This is clearly informative: The conditional probability of <span class="math">A</span> given
    <span class="math">B</span> is zero!
    This changes the (conditional) probability of <span class="math">A</span> unless its
    (unconditional) probability was zero.
</p>

<p>
    Independent events bear a special relationship to each other.
    Independence is a very precise point between being disjoint
    (so that the occurrence of one event implies that the other did not occur),
    and one event being a <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#subset">subset</a> of the
    other (so that the occurrence of one event implies the occurrence of the other).
    Here is a summary of the contrast between independent events and
    mutually exclusive events:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If two events are mutually exclusive, they cannot both occur
        in the same trial: The probability of their intersection is zero.
        The probability of their union is the sum of their probabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        If two events are independent, both can occur in the same trial
        (except possibly if at least one of them has probability zero).
        The probability of their intersection is the product of their
        probabilities.
        The probability of their union is less than the sum of their
        probabilities, unless at least one of the events has
        probability zero.
    </li>
</ul>

    contains a Venn diagram that represents two events,
    <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>, as subsets of a rectangle <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.
    The probabilities of the events are proportional to their areas.
    Initially, the probability of <span class="math">A</span> is 30% and the probability
    of <span class="math">B</span> is 20%.
    The figure also shows the probability of <span class="math">AB</span> and of
    <span class="math">A&cup;B</span>.
    Try to make <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> independent by dragging them to make
    the area of their intersection equal to the product of their areas,
    so that <span class="math">P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B) = 30%&times;20% = 6%</span>.
    It is hard to get just the right amount of overlap:
    Independence is a very special relationship between events.

    What kinds of events are (generally assumed to be) independent?
    The outcomes of successive fair tosses
    of a fair coin, the outcomes of random draws from a box with replacement, <em>etc.</em>
    Draws without replacement are
    <a href="gloss.htm#dependent" class="glossRef">dependent</a>,
    because what can happen on a given
    draw depends on what happens on previous draws.
    The next two examples illustrate the contrast between independent and dependent events.
</p>

<div class="example">

<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"> <!--
    var qStr = 'Drawing at Random from a Box of Tickets.';
    writeExampleCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>

<p>
    Suppose I have a box with four tickets in it, labeled
    1, 2, 3, and 4.
    I stir the tickets and then draw one from the box,
    stir the remaining tickets again without returning the ticket I drew the first
    time, and draw another ticket.
    Consider the event <span class="math">A</span> = {I get the ticket labeled 1 on the first draw} and the
    event <span class="math">B = {I get the ticket labeled 2 on the second draw}</span>.
    Are <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> dependent or independent?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution: </strong>
    The chance that I get the 1 on the first draw is 25%.
    The chance that I get the 2 on the second draw is 25%.
    The chance that I get the 2 on the second draw given that
    I get the 1 on the first draw is 33%, which is much larger
    than the unconditional chance that I draw the 2 the second time.
    Thus <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are dependent.
</p>

<p>
    Now suppose that I replace the ticket I got on the first
    draw and stir the tickets again before drawing the second time.
    Then the chance that I get the 1 on the first draw is 25%,
    the chance that I get the 2 on the second draw is 25%, and
    the conditional chance that I get the 2 on the second draw
    given that I drew the 1 the first time is also 25%.
    <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are thus independent if I draw with replacement.

<p>
    Two fair dice are rolled independently; one is blue, the other is red.
    What is the chance that the number of spots that show on the red die is
    less than the number of spots that show on the blue die?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>: The event that the number of spots that

    according to the number of spots that show on the blue die.
    The chance that the number of spots that show on the red die is
    less than the number that show on the blue die is the sum of the
    chances of those simpler events.
    If only one spot shows on the blue die, the number that shows on the
    red die cannot be smaller, so the probability is zero.
    If two spots show on the blue die, the number that shows
    on the red die is smaller if the red die shows exactly one spot.
    Because the numbers of spots that show on the blue and red dice are
    independent, the chance that the blue die shows two spots and the
    red die shows one spot is (1/6)(1/6) = 1/36.
    If three spots show on the blue die, the number that shows on the red
    die is smaller if the red die shows one or two spots.
    The chance that the blue die shows three spots and the red die
    shows one or two spots is (1/6)(2/6) = 2/36.
    If four spots show on the blue die, the number that show on the
    red die is smaller if the red die shows one, two, or three spots;
    the chance that the blue die shows four spots and the red die
    shows one, two, or three spots is (1/6)(3/6) = 3/36.
</p>

<p>
    Proceeding similarly for the cases that the blue die shows five or
    six spots gives the ultimate result:
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(red die shows fewer spots than the blue die) =
    1/36 + 2/36 + 3/36 + 4/36 + 5/36 = 15/36.
</p>

    Alternatively, one could just count the ways:
    There are 36 possibilities, which can be written in a square table as follows.

    The outcomes above the diagonal comprise the event whose probability we seek.
    There are 36 outcomes in all, of which 6 are on the diagonal.
    Half of the remaining 36-6=30 are above the diagonal; half of 30 is 15.
    The 36 outcomes are equally likely, so the chance is 15/36.
    The outcomes highlighted in yellow&mdash;(1,4), (2,4) and (3,4)&mdash;comprise one of the

    Bayes' Rule is useful to find the conditional probability of
    <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span> in terms of the conditional probability
    of <span class="math">B</span> given <span class="math">A</span>,
    which is the more natural quantity to measure in some
    problems, and the easier quantity to compute in some
    problems. For example, in screening for a disease, the
    natural way to calibrate a test is to see how well it does at
    detecting the disease when the disease is present, and to see
    how often it raises false alarms when the disease is not
    present.
    These are, respectively, the conditional probability of
    detecting the disease given that the disease is present,
    and the conditional probability of incorrectly raising an alarm
    given that the disease is not present.
    However, the interesting quantity for an individual is the
    conditional chance that he or she has the disease,
    given that the test raised an alarm.
    An example will help.
</p>

<div class="example">

<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"> <!--
    var qStr = 'Bayes\' Rule in Disease Screening';
    writeExampleCaption(qStr);
// -->
</script>

<p>
    Suppose that 10% of a given population has benign chronic flatulence.
    Suppose that there is a standard screening test for benign chronic
    flatulence that has a 90% chance of correctly detecting that one has
    the disease, and a 10% chance of a <em>false positive</em>
    (erroneously reporting that one has the disease when one does not).
    We pick a person at random from the population (so that everyone has
    the same chance of being picked) and test him/her.
    The test is positive. What is the chance that the person has the disease?
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Solution</strong>:
    We shall combine several things we have learned.
    Let <span class="math">D</span> be the event that the person has the disease, and let
    <span class="math">T</span> be
    the event that the person tests positive for the disease.
    The problem statement told us that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="math">P(D) = 10%</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="math">P(T | D) = 90%</span>.</li>
    <li><span class="math">P(T | D<sup>c</sup>) = 10%</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The problem asks us to find <span class="math">P(D | T) = P(DT)/P(T)</span>.
    We shall find <span class="math">P(T)</span>
    by partitioning <span class="math">T</span> into two mutually exclusive
    pieces, <span class="math">DT</span> and <span class="math">D<sup>c</sup>T</span>, corresponding to
    testing positive and having the disease (<span class="math">DT</span>) and testing positive falsely
    (<span class="math">D<sup>c</sup>T</span>).
    Then <span class="math">P(T)</span> is the sum of <span class="math">P(DT)</span>
    and <span class="math">P(D<sup>c</sup>T)</span>.
    We will find those two probabilities using the Multiplication Rule.
    We need <span class="math">P(DT)</span> for the numerator, and it will be one of the
    terms in the denominator as well.
    The probability of <span class="math">DT</span> is, by the Multiplication Rule,
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(DT) = P(T | D) &times; P(D) = 90% &times; 10% = 9%.
</p>

<p>
    The probability of <span class="math">D<sup>c</sup>T</span> is, by the multiplication
    rule and the complement rule,
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(D<sup>c</sup>T) = P(T | D<sup>c</sup>) &times;
    P(D<sup>c</sup>) = P(T | D<sup>c</sup>) &times;
    (100% &minus; P(D) ) = 10% &times; 90% = 9%.
</p>

<p>
    By the third axiom,
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(T) = P(DT) + P(D<sup>c</sup>T) = 9% + 9% = 18%,
</p>

<p>
    because <span class="math">DT</span> and <span class="math">D<sup>c</sup>T</span> are mutually exclusive.
    Finally, plugging in the definition of <span class="math">P(D | T)</span> gives:
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(D | T) = P(DT)/P(T) = 9%/18% = 50%.
</p>

<p>
    Because only a small fraction of the population actually have benign chronic
    flatulence, the chance that a positive test result for someone
    selected at random from the population is a false positive is
    50%, even though the test is 90% accurate.
    The computation we just made is equivalent to using Bayes' rule:
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(D | T) =
    P(T | D)&times;P(D)/(P(T | D)&times;P(D) +
    P(T | D<sup>c</sup>)&times;P(D<sup>c</sup>) )
</p>

<p class="math">
    = 90%&times;10%/( 90%&times;10% + 10%&times;90%)
</p>

<p class="math">
    = 50%.
</p>
</div>

<p>
   The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#base_rate_fallacy">Base Rate Fallacy</a>
   consists of ignoring <span class="math">P(A)</span>
   or <span class="math">P(B)</span>
   in computing <span class="math">P(B | A)</span> from <span class="math">P(A | B)</span> and
   <span class="math">P(A | B<sup>c</sup>)</span>.
   For instance, in the example above, the base rate for chronic benign flatulence is 10%.
   The test is 90% accurate (both for false positives and for false negatives).
   The base rate fallacy is to conclude that since the test is 90% accurate, it must be true that 90% of people
   who test positive in fact have the disease&mdash;ignoring the base rate of the disease in the population
   and the frequency of false positive test results.
   We just saw that that conclusion is wrong: if people are tested at random, of those who test positive,
   only 50% have the disease, on average.

   The <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#prosecutors_fallacy">Prosecutor's Fallacy</a>

   if the accused is guilty, <span class="math">P(B | A)</span> is the probability that
   the accused is guilty given the evidence.

<h2><a id="summary"></a>Summary</h2>

<p>
    The <em>Axioms of Probability</em> are mathematical rules that
    must be followed in assigning probabilities to events:
    The probability of an event cannot be negative, the probability that
    something happens must be 100%, and if two events cannot both occur,
    the probability that either occurs is the sum of the probabilities
    that each occurs.
    A function that assigns numbers to events and satisfies the axioms
    is called a <em>probability distribution</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The axioms have numerous consequences, including the following:
    The probability of the empty set is zero.
    The probability that a given event does not occur is 100% minus the
    probability that the event occurs.
    The probability that either of two events occurs is the sum of the
    probabilities that each occurs, minus the probability that both occur.
    The probability that either of two events occurs is at least as large
    as the probability that each occurs, and no larger than the sum of
    the probabilities that each occurs.
    The probability that two events both occur is no larger than either
    of their individual probabilities.
</p>

<p>
    Conditioning describes updating probabilities to incorporate new knowledge.
    For example, how should we update the probability of the event <span class="math">A</span>
    if we learn that the event <span class="math">B</span> occurs?
    The updated probability is the <em>conditional probability of</em>
    <span class="math">A</span> <em>given</em> <span class="math">B</span>,
    which is equal to the probability
    that <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>
    both occur, divided by the probability that <span class="math">B</span> occurs,
    provided that the probability that <span class="math">B</span> occurs is not zero.
    Conditional probability satisfies the axioms of probability.
</p>

<p>
    Rearranging the definition of conditional probability yields the
    <span class="termOfArt">Multiplication Rule</span>:
    The probability that <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> both
    occur is the conditional probability of <span class="math">A</span> given <span class="math">B</span>, times the
    probability that <span class="math">B</span> occurs.
    Two events are <em>independent</em> if the occurrence of one is
    uninformative with respect to the occurrence of the other:
    if <span class="math">P(A | B) = P(A)</span>.
    A slightly more general definition is that <span class="math">A</span> and
    <span class="math">B</span> are independent
    if <span class="math">P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B)</span>.
</p>

<p>
    Bayes' Rule expresses <span class="math">P(A | B)</span> in terms
    of <span class="math">P(B | A)</span>,
    <span class="math">P(B | A<sup>c</sup>)</span>, and
    <span class="math">P(A)</span>,
    which in some problems are easier to calculate than <span class="math">P(A | B)</span>.
    Bayes' Rule says that
</p>

<p class="math">
    P(A | B) =
    P(B | A)&times;P(A)/<big>(</big>
    P(B | A)&times;P(A) +
    P(B | A<sup>c</sup>)&times;P(A<sup>c</sup>)
    <big>)</big>
</p>

<p>
   The <em>base rate fallacy</em> consists of ignoring <span class="math">P(A)</span>
   or <span class="math">P(B)</span>
   in computing <span class="math">P(B | A)</span> from <span class="math">P(A | B)</span> and
   <span class="math">P(A | B<sup>c</sup>)</span>.
   The <em>prosecutor's fallacy</em> consists of confusing <span class="math">P(A | B)</span>
   for <span class="math">P(B | A)</span>.
