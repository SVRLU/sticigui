<h2>
  <a id="how_to_use"></a>How to use these materials
</h2>
<p>
    You are probably using either
    <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_new">Firefox</a>,
    <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome" target="_new">Google Chrome</a>,
    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/" target="_new">Internet Explorer</a>,
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/" target="_new">Safari</a>
    or <a href="http://www.opera.com" target="_new">Opera</a> to view these materials.
    Those are the most popular web browsers.
    To use all the features of SticiGui<sup>&copy;</sup>, you need an up-to-date browser that
    supports frames, cascading style sheets (CSS), HTML 4.01, JavaScript 1.4, and Java 1.1.
    For a variety of reasons, I strongly recommend that you use Firefox and that you
    not use Internet Explorer.
    Recent versions of Chrome, Safari and Opera also work&mdash;mostly.
    The materials have been tested most thoroughly with Firefox.
</p>
<p>
  A <em>link</em>
  is a piece of text you can &quot;click&quot; to see another document. You place
  the cursor over the link, then push the mouse button (left mouse button on a PC compatible
  computer) to &quot;follow&quot; the link. 
  Links in these materials are generally in blue type.
</p>

<p>
  Clicking a link can either replace the document in one of the frames
  you are viewing (not always the frame that has the link), or open a new
  window that displays the new document.
  If you have not changed the default settings in your browser, links to the
  glossary will be in green type; those take you to the right place in the
  glossary in the bottom frame, so that you don't lose your place in the
  book when you look up a term.
  Links to other materials are in blue type; those typically replace the contents
  of the frame you are reading.
</p>


<p>
  You should familiarize yourself with how
  your browser works to learn to navigate among windows.
  On the right side of the browser
  window, you should see a scroll bar. If there is a scrollbar, that means there is more to
  see&mdash;drag the slider down to see more of the text.
  On some computers, there is a
  &quot;page down&quot; button you can click to see the next screenful of text.
</p>

<p>
  In the assignments, the navigation buttons
  are suppressed to leave more room on the screen for text and graphics.
  You can still get a &quot;pop-up menu&quot; that will allow you to go back to the
  previous document.
  How you get the menu depends on the browser and the operating system.
  In Microsoft Windows, you get the pop-up menu by right-clicking in the open browser window.
  Most browsers have the ability to search within a document to find a word
  or phrase within a page.
  You might find that feature useful to search for a word in the <a href="gloss.htm">glossary</a>
  or a chapter of the text.
</p>
<p>
  There are graphical
  <a href="../../Java/Html/index.htm" target="bookWin">data analysis and visualization tools</a>
  throughout the text and assignments.
  To use them, you must have Java enabled in your browser.
  Every chapter has
  exercises to check your understanding. 
  I strongly recommend that you do all of them. Most
  of the exercises call for an answer in a box. 
  After you type in your answer, strike the
  &quot;return&quot; or &quot;enter&quot; key. 
  The symbol next to the question will change
  from a question mark&nbsp;
  <img src="../Graphics/answer_unknown.gif"
  alt="question mark" width="13" height="24">either to
  a green check
  <img src="../Graphics/answer_good.gif" alt="check" width="23" height="23">
  (if your answer is right) or to a red X
  <img src="../Graphics/answer_bad.gif" alt="X" width="25" height="22"> (if your answer is
  wrong).
  Multiple-choice questions automatically show the green check or red X when you
  select an answer.
  Multiple-multiple choice questions (&quot;select all that apply&quot;)
  are followed by a button you can click to check your answer.
  Clicking the mark after the question
  (the question mark, check, or X) will expand a box containing the correct answer, if you have
  already attempted the problem.
  You can answer each question as many times as you like, or see the correct answer.
  More detailed solutions to some of the exercises are available too; there is a link to the
  detailed answers after those questions.
  Your answers to the exercises in the text are not
  recorded, and the exercises do not contribute to your grade.
  Many of the problems are
  generated randomly&mdash;reloading or revisiting the page will give you a new set of
  problems, so you can get unlimited practice.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the chapters have a corresponding
  <a href="../Problems/index.htm" target="_top">assignment</a> covering the
  material in the chapter.
  The assignments are graded by a computer, and may contribute to
  your grade (your instructor will tell you).
  Be sure to click the button labeled
  &quot;Submit for Grading&quot; after you answer the questions in each assignment.
  After the due date of the problem
  set, you can <a href="../Problems/index.htm" target="_top">see your score</a>
  by filling out a form.
  You can also see the solutions after the due date by returning
  to the assignment.
  For
  <a href="../Problems/index.htm#general_instructions" target="_self">detailed instructions
  about the assignments</a>, including browser-related issues, see the
  <a href="../Problems/index.htm" target="_self">homework homepage</a>.
