  Set Theory: The Language of Probability
</h1>

<p>
    The mathematics of probability is expressed most naturally in terms
    of sets.
    This chapter lays out the basic terminology and reviews naive set theory: how to define and
    manipulate sets of things, operations on sets that yield other sets, special
    relationships among sets, and so on.
    Translating word problems into the language of set theory is crucial in solving logic and
    probability problems.
    Venn diagrams are useful for visualizing the relationships among sets.
    In addition to its crucial role in probability, discussed in
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('probabilityAxioms') + ', ');
// -->
</script>
    set theory is intimately connected to 
    categorical logic, discussed in
<script language="JavaScript1.8" type="text/javascript"><!--
    document.writeln(citeLinkChapter('categoricalLogic') + ', ');
// -->
</script> 
    and to propositional logic, discussed in

<p>
      A <span class="termOfArt">set</span> is a collection of things (called the 
      <span class="termOfArt">elements</span> of the 
      set or the <span class="termOfArt">members</span> of the set) 
      without regard to their order. 
      We often define sets by
      listing their contents within curly braces {}. 
      For example, <span class="math">{1, 2, 3}</span> is the set whose elements are the numbers 1, 2, and 3. 
      Another way to define a set is to characterize
      its elements.
      For example <span class="math">{x : P(x)}</span>
      is the set of all values of <span class="math">x</span> for which 
      <span class="math">P(x)</span> is true.
      (The function <span class="math">P(x)</span> is called the 
      <span class="termOfArt">predicate function</span> or
      <span class="termOfArt">membership function</span>. 
      For more discussion, see

</p>

<p>   
      Sets usually are defined with respect to a universe of things 
      that contains everything of interest.
      The symbol <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> denotes the universe.
</p>

<p>
      <a id="venn_diagram"></a><span class="termOfArt">Venn diagrams</span>
      represent sets and the relationships among sets pictorially.
      A Venn diagram represents the universe <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> by a two-dimensional
      region (usually a rectangle or a circle).
      Sets within <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> are denoted by closed regions
      within <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.
      Shading or highlighting is used in Venn diagrams to draw attention
      to special relationships or sets.
      Here is a Venn diagram for <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.

      If <span class="math">x</span> is in the set <span class="math">A</span> we write 
      <span class="math">x&isin;A</span>, pronounced &quot;x is an element of
      A&quot; or &quot;x is a member of A.&quot;
      Equivalently, we write <span class="math">A&ni;x</span>, pronounced &quot;A contains x.&quot;
      If <span class="math">x</span> is not an element of <span class="math">A</span> 
      we write <span class="math">x&notin;A</span>.
      Here is a Venn diagram showing <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>,

      If the sets <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>

      Remember that order does not matter: the set <span class="math">{a, b, c}</span>
      is equal to the set <span class="math">{c, a, b}</span>, but not to the set

      is the set of all things in <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> that are <em>not</em>
      in <span class="math">A</span>.
      The complement of the set <span class="math">A</span> is pronounced 
      &quot;A complement&quot; or &quot;not A.&quot;
      For instance, if the universe <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is the set of living
      people and <span class="math">A</span> comprises all living people who are over 6' tall, then
      <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span> comprises all living people who are no more than 6' tall.
      If <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is the set of all ravens and 
      <span class="math">A</span> comprises all black ravens, then 
      <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span> is the set of all ravens that are not black.
      The complement of the complement of a set is the original set: 
      <span class="math">(A<sup>c</sup>)<sup>c</sup> = A</span>.
      The set of all ravens that are not (not black) is the set of all ravens that are black.
      Here is a Venn diagram illustrating the set <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span>.

    Suppose we have two sets, <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>.
    If every element of <span class="math">A</span> is also an element of <span class="math">B</span>,
    we say that <span class="math">A</span> is a <span class="termOfArt">subset</span> 
    of <span class="math">B</span>
    and we write <span class="math">A&sub;B</span> or <span class="math">B&sup;A</span>.
    For instance,  <span class="math">{1, 2}</span> is a subset of  
    <span class="math">{1, 2, 3}</span>, but 
    <span class="math">{1, 4}</span> is not a subset of <span class="math">{1, 2, 3}</span>. 
    With respect to the universe <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> of animals,
    the set of ravens is a subset of the set of birds, but
    the set of ravens is not a subset of the set of fish.
    Nor is the set of black birds a subset of the set of ravens, because some
    black birds are not ravens.
    Here is a Venn diagram illustrating <span class="math">A&sub;B</span>.

<div class="venn">

</div>

<p>
    Every set is a subset of itself, and the empty set <span class="math">{}</span> is a subset of
    every set.
    If <span class="math">A&sub;B</span> and <span class="math">B&sub;A</span> 
    then <span class="math">A = B</span>: every element of <span class="math">A</span> is an element
    of <span class="math">B</span> and vice versa.
    The subset relation is transitive: if  <span class="math">A&sub;B</span> and 
    <span class="math">B&sub;C</span> then <span class="math">A&sub;C</span>.
    For example, all ravens are birds and all birds are animals, so all ravens are animals.
    The subset relation is reversed by taking complements: if <span class="math">A&sub;B</span> then
    <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup>&sub;A<sup>c</sup></span>.
    For example, all ravens are birds, so all non-birds are non-ravens.
    If something is not a bird it is not a raven.
</p>

<p>
    If <span class="math">A</span> is not a subset of <span class="math">B</span>, we write
    <span class="math">A&nsub;B</span>.
    The not-subset relation is also reversed under complements:
    if <span class="math">A&nsub;B</span> then
    <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup>&nsub;A<sup>c</sup></span>.
    For example, if some birds are not ravens, then some non-ravens are birds (i.e., not non-birds).
    Here is a Venn diagram illustrating <span class="math">A&nsub;B</span>.

<p>
     Be careful not to confuse a set with its elements.
     For instance, <span class="math">A &ne; {A}</span>&mdash;the former is the thing
     <span class="math">A</span> while
     <span class="math">{A}</span> is a set with one element, namely, <span class="math">A</span>.
     Similarly, while <span class="math">A &isin; {A}</span>, <span class="math">A &nsub; {A}</span>.
</p>

<p>
      The <span class="termOfArt">intersection</span> of two or more sets is the collection 
      of elements they all have in common,
      that is, the set of things contained in each and every one of the sets.
      For instance, the intersection of the set <span class="math">{0, 1, 2, 3}</span> and the set
      <span class="math">{1, 3, 5}</span> is the set <span class="math">{1, 3}</span>.
      The intersection of the set <span class="math">{0, 1, 2, 3}</span> and the set
      <span class="math">{4, 5, 6}</span> is the empty set, <span class="math">{}</span>.
      The intersection of the set <span class="math">A</span> and the set <span class="math">B</span>
      is sometimes written <span class="math">A&cap;B</span> or <span class="math">AB</span>, and is pronounced

      &quot;A intersect B&quot; or &quot;A meet B.&quot;

      Two sets are <span class="termOfArt">disjoint</span> or <span class="termOfArt">mutually exclusive</span>
      if their intersection is the empty set;
      that is, if the two sets have no elements in common.
      For instance, the sets <span class="math">{1, 2, 3}</span> and <span class="math">{0, 4}</span>
      are disjoint.
      In symbols, <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are disjoint if 
      <span class="math">A&cap;B = {}</span>.
      Here is a Venn diagram illustrating that the sets <span class="math">A</span> and 
      <span class="math">B</span> are disjoint:
</p>
<div class="venn">
   <div class="vennCaption"> 
       <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> <span class="termOfArt">disjoint</span>:
       <span class="math">A&cap;B = {}</span>.
   </div>
   <div class="vennUniverse"><span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span></div>
   <div class="rect40x50_left blue left"><span class="math">A</span></div>

      A collection of sets <span class="math">{A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
      A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip; }</span>
      is <span class="termOfArt">disjoint</span> if every pair of sets in the collection 
      is disjoint; that is,
      the collection is disjoint if
      <span class="math">A<sub>i</sub>A<sub>j</sub> = {}</span> whenever
      <span class="math">i&ne;j</span>  (<span class="math">i&ne;j</span> means <span class="math">i</span>
      is not equal to <span class="math">j</span>).
      For instance, the sets <span class="math">{1, 2, 3}</span>, <span class="math">{0, 4}</span>,
      <span class="math">{5}</span>, and <span class="math">{-1, -2, -3, -4}</span> are disjoint, but
      the sets <span class="math">{1, 2, 3}</span>, <span class="math">{1, 4}</span>,
      <span class="math">{5}</span>, and <span class="math">{-1, -2, -3, -4}</span> are not.
      The set of black ravens and the set of white ravens are mutually exclusive.
      The empty set and any other set are mutually exclusive, because the intersection of the empty set
      and any other set is the empty set.

<p>
    Sometimes we need to ensure that every element of some set is in at least one set in a collection
    of sets.
    This issue arises in counting and in probability when we want to break a complicated set into smaller 
    pieces and know that we have not lost anything.
    The corresponding technical term is <span class="termOfArt">exhaust</span>.
    A collection of sets <span class="math">{A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
    A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip; }</span> <span class="termOfArt">exhausts</span> a set
    <span class="math">A</span> (the collection <em>is exhaustive of</em> <span class="math">A</span>) if
    every element of <span class="math">A</span> is in at least one of the sets
    <span class="math">A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
    A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip;</span>; that is, if
    <span class="math">A</span> is a subset of 
    <span class="math">A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> &cup;
    A<sub>3</sub> &cup; &hellip;</span> .
    For instance, the sets <span class="math">{1, 2, 3}</span>, <span class="math">{1, 4}</span>
    <span class="math">{3, 5}</span> and <span class="math">{-1, -2, -3, -4}</span> exhaust
    the set <span class="math">{2, 3, 4, 5}</span>, but they do not exhaust the set
    <span class="math">{0, 1, 2}</span>.
    The set of men, the set of women, and the set of children exhaust the set of people.
    The set of black ravens and the set of non-black ravens exhaust the set of ravens.

<p>
    Sometimes we need to ensure that every element of some set is in exactly one set in a collection
    of sets&mdash;and that nothing but members of that set are in the collection.
    This issue arises in counting and in probability when we want to break a complicated set into
    smaller parts while avoiding double-counting or counting anything extra.
    The corresponding technical term is <span class="termOfArt">partition</span>.
    A collection of sets <span class="math">{A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
    A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip; }</span> <span class="termOfArt">partitions</span> a set
    <span class="math">A</span> (the collection <em>is a partition of</em> <span class="math">A</span>) if
    the collection is disjoint, each element <span class="math">A<sub>1</sub></span>
    of the collection is a subset of <span class="math">A</span>, 
    and the collection exhausts <span class="math">A</span>;
    that is, if each element of <span class="math">A</span> is in exactly one of the sets
    <span class="math">A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
    A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip;</span> and <span class="math">A = A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub> &cup;
    A<sub>3</sub> &cup; &hellip;</span> .
    For instance, the sets <span class="math">{a}, {b, d},</span> and <span class="math">{c}</span>
    partition the set <span class="math">{a, b, c, d}</span>.
    The set of black ravens and the set of non-black ravens partition the set of ravens.

   The following exercises check your understanding of set membership, equality of sets, complements,
   unions, intersections, what it means for two sets to be disjoint, for a one set to be
   a subset of another, and for a collection of sets to exhaust or partition another set.

<h2><a id="connection"></a>
    Connecting Probability to Set Theory
</h2>

<p>
    A <span class="termOfArt">random experiment</span> or <span class="termOfArt">random trial</span> 
    is basically any
    situation whose outcome is not perfectly predictable, but for which we
    can specify all possible outcomes, and that shows long-term regularities.
    For example, when we toss a coin, we do not know how it will land,
    but it certainly must land heads, tails, on its edge, or not land at all.
    There is no other possibility.
    The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the
    <span class="termOfArt">outcome space</span>.
    The letter <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> will denote outcome space.
    We are free to choose the outcome space to correspond to what we deem
    relevant for the experiment, as long as it is essentially inevitable that the
    random experiment will result in some outcome in the outcome space.
    For example, the outcome space we just described was {heads, tails, edge, doesn't land}.
    It might be adequate for our purposes for the outcome space to be {heads, not heads}.
</p>

<p>
    Often we shall tailor outcome spaces for specific problems.
    Here is an example: Imagine a box containing tickets that are indistinguishable
    except that each has written upon it a unique number between 1 and the number
    of tickets, <span class="math">n</span>.
    We shake the box, draw a ticket from the box without looking, and record
    the number written on the ticket we happened to draw.
    The natural outcome space of this experiment is the set of numbers
    <span class="math">{1, 2,  &hellip; , n}</span>.
    However, suppose we are interested only in whether the number on the
    ticket we draw is even.
    The outcome space then could be reduced to {even number on ticket, odd number on ticket},
    or coded even more abstractly as <span class="math">{0, 1}</span>, where the outcome is the number of
    even-numbered tickets drawn.
</p>

<p>
    An <span class="termOfArt">event</span> is a subset of outcome space: a collection of outcomes in the
    outcome space.
    <span class="math">A</span> is an event if <span class="math">A&sub;<strong>S</strong></span>.
    For example, in the experiment of drawing a numbered ticket from the box,
    suppose there are 10 tickets in all, and that we choose the outcome space 
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> to be the numbers 
    <span class="math">{1, 2, 3,  &hellip; , 9, 10}</span>.
    Then &quot;we draw the number 1&quot; is the event <span class="math">{1}</span>, and
    &quot;we draw an even number&quot; is the event <span class="math">{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}</span>, 
    both of which are subsets of the set of possible outcomes, the outcome space 
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.
</p>

<p>
    Two events are <span class="termOfArt">disjoint</span> or 
    <span class="termOfArt">mutually exclusive</span>
    if the occurrence of one is incompatible with the occurrence of the other;
    that is, if they have no outcome in common.
    This is equivalent to the definition of <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#disjoint">disjoint</a>
    <a class="glossRef" href="gloss.htm#set">sets</a>, viewing
    events as sets.
    The event <span class="math">A</span> <span class="termOfArt">implies</span> the event 
    <span class="math">B</span> if 
    <span class="math">A&sub;B</span>: then if <span class="math">A</span> occurs, <span class="math">B</span> must
    also occur (if the outcome that occurs is in <span class="math">A</span>, the outcome
    that occurs is also in <span class="math">B</span>, because every element of <span class="math">A</span>
    is an element of <span class="math">B</span>).
</p>

    the universe <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> and two subsets of
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>, <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>.
    The figure has check boxes on the right side.
    Checking a box highlights the corresponding set;
    the options are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="math">A</span>, <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="math">B</span>, <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup></span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="math">A &cup; B, A&cap;B</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="math">A&cap;B<sup>c</sup>, A<sup>c</sup>B</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>, <span class="math">{}</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can click and drag <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> to change the amount by which
    they intersect.
    Scrollbars at the bottom of the figure let you change the sizes of <span class="math">A</span> and
    <span class="math">B</span>.
    Usually, Venn diagrams do not have a scale, but because this figure is intended to
    represent the outcome space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>, it represents the
    probability of an event by the area of the event.
    Probability is never greater than 100%, so the area of
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> in the diagram is 100%.
    The area of the subsets of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> represents their probability,
    so the areas of <span class="math">A</span> and of <span class="math">B</span> are between 0% and 100%;
    these are denoted P(A) and P(B) at the bottom of the figure.
    The areas of the events <span class="math">A&cap;B</span> and
    <span class="math">A&cup;B</span>
    are listed in the figure as
    P(AB) and P(A or B),
    respectively.

<h2><a id="summary"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>
    Sets are collections of things without regard to their order.
    Sets can be specified by listing their elements (the things in the set, also called members) or by giving
    a property satisfied by their members (and nothing else).
    The empty set, the set with no members, is <span class="math">{}</span>.
    Set operations turn sets into other sets.
    If <span class="math">x</span> is in the set <span class="math">A</span> we write 
    <span class="math">x&isin;A</span> or <span class="math">A&ni;x</span>.
    The <span class="termOfArt">complement</span> of a set <span class="math">A</span>, 
    <span class="math">A<sup>c</sup></span>,
    relative to a &quot;universe&quot; of elements <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>,
    is the set of members of the reference universe
    <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> that are not in <span class="math">A</span>.
    The set <span class="math">A</span> is a <span class="termOfArt">subset</span> 
    of the set <span class="math">B</span> (<span class="math">A&sub;B</span>)
    if every element of <span class="math">A</span> is also an element of <span class="math">B</span>.
    If <span class="math">A</span> is not a subset of <span class="math">B</span>, we write
    <span class="math">A&nsub;B</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The empty set is a subset of every set.
    Thus, the statement <span class="math">A&sub;B</span> can be true even if neither <span class="math">A</span>
    nor <span class="math">B</span> has any members.
    But for <span class="math">A&nsub;B</span> to be true, <span class="math">A</span> must have at least one
    member, as must <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup></span>.
    If <span class="math">A&sub;B</span> then <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup>&sub;A<sup>c</sup></span>
    and if <span class="math">A&nsub;B</span> then <span class="math">B<sup>c</sup>&nsub;A<sup>c</sup></span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="termOfArt">intersection</span> of the set 
    <span class="math">A</span> and the set <span class="math">B</span>,
    <span class="math">A&cap;B</span> (also written <span class="math">A&cap;B</span>), is the
    set of things that are in both <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>.
    If <span class="math">A&cap;B = A</span> then <span class="math">A&sub;B</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The <span class="termOfArt">union</span> of the set 
    <span class="math">A</span> and the set <span class="math">B</span>,
    <span class="math">A&cup;B</span>,
    contains every element of <span class="math">A</span>, 
    every element of <span class="math">B</span>, and nothing else.
    If <span class="math">A&cup;B = A</span> then <span class="math">B&sub;A</span>.
</p>

<p>
    The sets <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are 
    <span class="termOfArt">disjoint</span> or 
    <span class="termOfArt">mutually exclusive</span>
    if they have no elements in common, that is, if <span class="math">A&cap;B</span> = {}.
    The collection <span class="math">{A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
    A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip; }</span> <span class="termOfArt">exhausts</span>
    <span class="math">A</span> if every element of <span class="math">A</span> is in at least one of the
    sets in the collection; that is, if <span class="math">A &sub; A<sub>1</sub>
    &cup; A<sub>2</sub>
    &cup; A<sub>3</sub>&cup; &hellip;</span> .
    The collection
    <span class="math">{A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip; }</span>
    is <span class="termOfArt">disjoint</span> if 
    <span class="math">A<sub>i</sub>A<sub>j</sub> = {}</span>
    when <span class="math">i &ne; j</span>.
    The collection
    <span class="math">{A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, &hellip; }</span> is a
    <span class="termOfArt">partition</span> of
    <span class="math">A</span> if every element of <span class="math">A</span> is in
    exactly one of the sets in the collection and nothing else is; that is, if the collection is
    disjoint and <span class="math">A = A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>2</sub>
    &cup; A<sub>3</sub>&cup; &hellip;</span> .
</p>

<p>
    Outcome space <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span> is the set of all things that
    could possibly happen in an experiment.
    Events are subsets of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.
    The event <span class="math">A</span> occurs if the outcome of the experiment is an element of
    <span class="math">A</span>; otherwise, <span class="math">A</span> does not occur.
    Two events are disjoint or mutually exclusive if they have no outcomes in 
    common&mdash;if they are disjoint subsets of <span class="math"><strong>S</strong></span>.
    Disjoint events cannot occur simultaneously.
    For example, if a coin is tossed, the event that the coin lands &quot;heads&quot;
    and the event that the coin lands &quot;tails&quot; are disjoint.
