<h1>Case Study: Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE)</h1>

<p>
   There are a variety of such diseases in mammals, including
   scrapie (sheep), kuru (humans, Papua New Guinea, from eating human brains),
   <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001792/">Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease</a> (CJD),
   variant CJD,
   Chronic Wasting Disease (deer, elk),
   Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy,
   Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, discovered in 1986).
   TSEs are invariably fatal.
   They cause lesions and Causes lesions and holes in the brain,
   leaving the brain looking sponge-like&mdash;hence &quot;spongiform.&quot;
   Incubation period varies, but generally years in large mammals (like cows and us).
   But once symptoms appear, incapacitation and death follow
   relatively quickly.
</p>

<p>
   TSE is transmissible (by definition).
   There's a genetic component to the susceptibility and the incubation time, and a possibility
   that infection can be passed from mother to offspring.
   (The &quot;natural&quot; CJD also runs in families, apparently due to genetics, not infection.)
   Whatever the causative agent is, it replicates in the &quot;host.&quot;
   It is not a virus or bacteria.
   It is quite hard to &quot;denature&quot;: it survives heat, radiation, etc.
   It alters the three-dimensional structure (folding) of a kind of protein, prion (pRP).
   Thought to be in fact the same protein it affects, but abnormally folded.
   According to one theory, the natural form unfolds periodically; if the abnormal form
   is present, it guides the unfolded protein into the wrong configuration.
   This cascades.
</p>

<p>
   The infectious agent is concentrated in the brain and some other tissues (CNS, distal ileum in cattle).
</p>

<p>
   BSE transmissible to cats, dogs, goats, deer, mice, pigs, monkeys.
   Unusual for infectious agents to be able to cross &quot;species barriers.&quot;
</p>

<p>
   Transmission routes: feed (primary), maternal (rare but possible), contact (no evidence but not impossible).
   Cattle most susceptible before they are two years old.
   Incubation period on the order of 5&ndash;7 years.
</p>

<p>
   There was a BSE epidemic in the United Kingdom, starting around 1986.
   It was eventually controlled, but millions of cattle were infected, and millions were culled from the herd
   as a preventive measure.
</p>

<p>
   A number of people contracted vCJD from eating infected cattle.
   vCJD is generally fatal within a year of showing symptoms.
</p>

<p>
   BSE has been found in the U.S., but no infected cattle were found between 19?? and 2012, when
   an (asymptomatic) infected dairy cow was discovered at a processing plant.

<h2>The ban on importing Canadian beef and cattle</h2>

<p>
   In May 2003, a BSE-infected beef cow was discovered in Alberta, Canada.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture banned imports of Canadian cattle and beef in response.
   In November 2003 the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed allowing beef and cattle less than 30 months
   old to be imported, with special restrictions on how they are slaughtered and their intestines are disposed
   of (the distal ileum, part of the small intestine, can contain a concentration of the infectious agent).
   <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2003-11-04/pdf/03-27611.pdf">
   http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2003-11-04/pdf/03-27611.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
   The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-CALF) sued the federal government to
   keep out Canadian cattle, citing public health concerns.
   An expert witness, Dr. Louis Anthony Cox, wrote declarations on their behalf, estimating that
   opening the border would result in about 11 infected cattle being introduced into the U.S. each year.
   I analyzed Dr. Cox's analysis (and portions of the Federal Register and the epidemiological literature
   and studies by various european government agencies) on behalf of the U.S.D.A. and came to rather
   different conclusions.
</p>


<h2>Does heterogeneity help or hurt?</h2>

<p>
   Four cows in Canada, two with BSE.
   Select two at random.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 3/4 \).
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two in British Columbia, two in Alberta.
   One in each province has BSE.
   Select one from each province at random.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 3/4 \).
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two in British Columbia, two in Alberta.
   Two in Alberta have BSE; none in BC does.
   Select one from each province at random.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 1 \).
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two in British Columbia, two in Alberta.
   Two in Alberta have BSE; none in BC does.
   Select two (i.e., both) from BC.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 0 \).
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two over 5 years old, two under 2 years old.
   The older two have BSE; the younger two do not.
   Select two (i.e., both) younger cows.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 0 \).
</p>

<h2>Surveillance</h2>

<p>
   U.S. tests 40,000 cattle per year.
   Suppose the tests were of randomly selected cattle (every animal equally likely to be selected).
   Suppose all the tests are negative.
   What can we say about the prevalence of BSE in the U.S. herd?
   40,000 is a tiny fraction of cattle&mdash;is it too few?
</p>

<p>
   If the prevalence were 1%, what would the chance of at least one positive test result be?
</p>

<p class="math">
   \(P(\mbox{at least one positive}) = 100\% - P(\mbox{all negative}) = 100\% - (99\%)^{40,000} \approx 100\%. \)
</p>

<p>
   Even if the prevalence were 0.01% (one in ten thousand), the chance of at least one positive test would be
</p>

<p class="math">
   \(100\% - (99.99\%)^{40,000} \approx 98.2\%.\)
</p>

<p>
  Other Foodborne and Waterborne Risks.
</p>

 <ul>
       <li> Amoebiasis (diarrhea, fever) </li>
       <li> Salmonellosis (diarrhea, cramps, dehydration) </li>
       <li> E.~coli (diarrhea, dehydration) </li>
       <li> Campylobacteriosis (dysentery, fever: I was hospitalized with this) </li>
       <li> Cholera (rapidly fatal: nausea, cramps, hypovolemic shock) </li>
       <li> Streptococcus (I spent 4.5 months bedridden, on IV antibiotics) </li>
       <li> Giardiasis (diarrhea, bloating. Yep, I've had that, too) </li>
       <li> Legionellosis (a friend's mother died of this) </li>
       <li> Leptospirosis  (meningitis, liver damage, kidney failure) </li>
       <li> Cryptosporidiosis (cramps, nausea, vomiting) </li>
       <li> Botulism (double vision, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory failure, death) </li>
       <li> Aflatoxin </li>
       <li> Typhoid fever </li>
       <li> Vibrio </li>
       <li> SARS </li>
       <li> Hepatitis A </li>
       <li> Polio </li>
       <li> Polyomavirus infection </li>
 </ul>

   Who benefits? Who suffers? Who pays?

<p>
   Why did R-CALF litigate?
   Do you think it's a question of public health?
