<h1>Case Study: Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE)</h1>

<p>
   There are a variety of TSE diseases in mammals, including
   scrapie (sheep), kuru (humans, Papua New Guinea, from eating human brains),
   <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001792/">Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease</a> (CJD),
   variant CJD,
   Chronic Wasting Disease (deer, elk),
   Feline Spongiform Encephalopathy,
   Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE, discovered in 1986).
   TSEs are invariably fatal.
   They cause lesions and Causes lesions and holes in the brain,
   leaving the brain looking sponge-like&mdash;hence &quot;spongiform.&quot;
   Incubation period varies, but generally years in large mammals (like cows and us).
   But once symptoms appear, incapacitation and death follow
   relatively quickly.
</p>

<p>
   TSE is transmissible (by definition).
   There's a genetic component to the susceptibility and the incubation time, and a possibility
   that infection can be passed from mother to offspring.
   (The &quot;natural&quot; CJD also runs in families, apparently due to genetics, not infection.)
   Whatever the causative agent is, it replicates in the &quot;host.&quot;
   It is not a virus or bacteria.
   It is quite hard to &quot;denature&quot;: it survives heat, radiation, etc.
   It alters the three-dimensional structure (folding) of a kind of protein, prion (pRP).
   Thought to be in fact the same protein it affects, but abnormally folded.
   According to one theory, the natural form unfolds periodically; if the abnormal form
   is present, it guides the unfolded protein into the wrong configuration.
   This cascades.
</p>

<p>
   The infectious agent is concentrated in the brain and some other tissues (CNS, distal ileum in cattle).
</p>

<p>
   BSE transmissible to cats, dogs, goats, deer, mice, pigs, monkeys.
   Unusual for infectious agents to be able to cross &quot;species barriers.&quot;
</p>

<p>
   Transmission routes: feed (primary), maternal (rare but possible), contact (no evidence but not impossible).
   Cattle most susceptible before they are two years old.
   Incubation period on the order of 5&ndash;7 years.
   Also thought to occur &quot;in the wild&quot; (sporadically) at some rate
   in cattle (type H BSE, thought to be genetic) as well as in humans (CJD) and other species (e.g., scrapie in
   sheep and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk).

<h2>The BSE Epidemic in the UK</h2>

<p>
   There was a BSE epidemic in the United Kingdom, starting around 1986.
   It was eventually controlled, but more than 184,000 cases were diagnosed
   and millions of cattle were culled from the herd as a preventive measure.
</p>

<p>
   Thought to be caused by feeding sheep to cows: protein supplements, especially for dairy cows.
   Generally contracted by age 2.
   Little if any transmission other than through feed.
</p>

<p>
   Ban and culling stopped the epidemic:
   There were only 11 new cases in the U.K. in 2010.
   Banning the feeding of ruminants to ruminants essentially stops the transmission,
   although there are sporadic cases and evidence that maternal transmission is possible.
</p>

<p>
   A number of people contracted vCJD from eating infected cattle.
   vCJD is generally fatal within a year of showing symptoms.
</p>

<p>
   BSE has been found in the U.S., but no infected cattle were found between 2006 and 2012, when
   an (asymptomatic) infected dairy cow was discovered at a processing plant.
</p>

<h2>The ban on importing Canadian beef and cattle</h2>

<p>
   In May 2003, a BSE-infected beef cow was discovered in Alberta, Canada.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture banned imports of Canadian cattle and beef in response.
   In November 2003 the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed allowing beef and cattle less than 30 months
   old to be imported, with special restrictions on how they are slaughtered and their intestines are disposed
   of (the distal ileum, part of the small intestine, can contain a concentration of the infectious agent).
   The U.S.D.A. cited Canada's 1997 ban on feeding mammals to ruminants as part of the justification:
   feed bans are very effective.
   (The U.S. considers it adequate to ban feeding ruminants to ruminants.)
   <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2003-11-04/pdf/03-27611.pdf">
   http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2003-11-04/pdf/03-27611.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
   The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-CALF) sued the federal government to
   keep out Canadian cattle, citing public health concerns.
   An expert witness, Dr. Louis Anthony Cox, wrote declarations on their behalf, estimating that
   opening the border would result in about 9 infected cattle being introduced into the U.S. each year,
   and essentially certainly one or more.
   He also argued that it was essentially certain that at least one person per year would become infected with
   vCJD as a result.
   I analyzed Dr. Cox's analysis (and portions of the Federal Register and the epidemiological literature
   and studies by various European government agencies) on behalf of the U.S.D.A. and came to rather
   different conclusions.
</p>

<h3>Dr. Cox's analysis</h3>

<p>
   How did Dr. Cox arrive at 11 infected cattle per year?
</p>

<p>
   According to Dr. Cox, at that time the Canadian government tested about
   <span class="math">\(2769 + 4000 + 1300 = 8069\)</span> cattle and found
   3 with BSE, a rate of 0.037%.
   The cattle tested were not a random sample, however: Canada targeted animals thought
   to have higher risk of BSE.
   In Europe, the incidence in &quot;high-risk&quot; was about 60 times higher than
   in the general herd.
   Cox estimated that the rate in the Canadian herd is about 5.5 per million.
   He said that if imports resumed, the U.S. would import about 1.7 million cattle per year.
   On that basis, he concludes that the U.S. should expect to import about
   <span class="math">\( 5.5 \times 1.7 = 9.35\)</span> infected cattle per year.
</p>

<p>
   Cox says there is a greater than 99% chance of importing at least one infected cow per year
   if the infection rate is even 3 per million in the Canadian herd.
   Where does this probability come from?
</p>

<p>
    Imagine tossing a biased coin that has chance <span class="math">\(p\)</span> of landing heads
    <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times, independently.
    If <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is very small and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is very large,
    the chance that the coin lands heads at least once is about <span class="math">\(100\% - e^{-np}\)</span>.
    Using this approximation, if all Canadian cattle had the same chance of being infected
    and we imported 1.7million randomly, the chance at least one would be infected is
    about <span class="math">\(100\% - e^{-5.5\times3} = 99.4\%\)</span>.
</p>

<p>
   Using similar logic, Cox estimates that there would be about 72 servings of infected beef in the
   U.S. as a result of importing Canadian cattle.
   This number comes from multiplying 3.6 BSE-positives per million cattle times a 1% rate
   of failing to remove all the infective material times a billion pounds of beef times
   two servings per pound.
   He estimates that about 40% of those servings would be consumed by
   individuals &quot;susceptible&quot; to vCJD.
   (Both the 1% rate and the 40% rate appear to be entirely speculative.)
   From that he estimates that there would be about <span class="math">\(72 \times 0.4 = 28.8\)</span>
   human infections of vCJD per year.
</p>

<p>
   Moreover, he estimates that the chance of at least one such infection per year is essentially
   100%.
   Where does that number come from?
   Again, if we view infections as if they resulted from independent tosses of
   a coin with a fixed chance 40% of heads, the chance of getting at least one head in 72 tosses
   would be <span class="math">\(100\% - 60\%^72\)</span>, which is essentially 100%.

<h3>A closer look</h3>

<p>
   Let's think about Dr. Cox's numbers and assumptions.
   Dr. Cox said that the rate of BSE in imported cattle would be about 1/60
   of the rate in the high-risk group.
   That ignores the fact that only young cattle could be imported, and that BSE takes a long time to develop.
   The number should have been about 1/3000 of the rate in the herd as a whole,
   based on what was observed in the European Union (EU).
   (In the UK, only one in 10,000 BSE-positives were in cattle under 30 months old.)
   Dr. Cox did not take into account variations by age (including whether the animal was born
   after the feed ban), geography, etc.
   The approximation he used to find probabilities does not fit the Canadian data&mdash;nor the data for
   other countries, including the UK, France, and Switzerland.
</p>

<p>
   Dr. Cox assumes that if imports resumed, the U.S. would bring in 1.7 million head of cattle per year.
   The National Cattlemen's Beef association estimated the number fo be 900,000, and the U.S.D.A. estimated it
   to be 1.4 million.
</p>

<p>
   Meat and other tissue&mdash;except the tonsils and distal ilium&mdash;are rarely infectious until at least
   32 months after exposure.
   The regulations would require slaughter before the animal reached 30 months of age.
   Meat has never been found to be infectious.
</p>

<p>
   All four infected Canadian cattle that had been discovered by the time of this proceedings were
   from a region 280 miles across; they were 6&ndash;8 years old at the time of diagnosis;
   and three of the four were exposed to meat and bone meal processed before the feed ban by
   the same renderer, shipped in a one-month period in 1997.
</p>

<p>
   Rates are not probabilities.
   If some event has a probability, then in repeated trials, the fraction of times it
   occurs tends to converge to the probability.
   But just because something has a rate does not mean it is the result of a random
   process.
   In Cox's argument, he invents a probability model to turn an estimated rate of BSE in the Canadian
   herd into an estimated probability that one or more infected animals will be imported.
   He does something similar to estimate the chance that at least one person will be infected with vCJD
   as a result.
   However, his model has no basis in fact, and actually contradicts the existing data.
</p>

<h3>Does heterogeneity help or hurt?</h3>

<p>
   Dr. Cox argues that violations of his assumptions would only make matters worse.
   For instance, he says that ignoring heterogeneity&mdash;variations in the rate
   of infection across geography, age, time, etc., makes his result optimistic.
   To see that this assertion is incorrect, consider several scenarios with and
   without heterogeneity.
</p>

<p>
   Four cows in Canada, two with BSE.
   Select two at random.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 3/4 \).
   This is an example of homogeneity.
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two in British Columbia, two in Alberta.
   One in each province has BSE.
   Select one from each province at random.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 3/4 \).
   This situation is still homogeneous: we have two strata, BC and Alberta, but the rates
   in the two strata are equal.
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two in British Columbia, two in Alberta.
   Two in Alberta have BSE; none in BC does.
   Select one from each province at random.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 1 \).
   Here we have heterogeneity: the rate of infection is higher in Alberta than in BC.
   In this case, Dr. Cox is right: heterogeneity would increase the chance of importing
   infected animals.
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two in British Columbia, two in Alberta.
   Two in Alberta have BSE; none in BC does.
   Select two (i.e., both) from BC.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 0 \).
   Here the heterogeneity is as before, but if we do not sample from the stratum known
   to be infected, heterogeneity decreases the chance of importing infected animals.
</p>

<p>
   Four cows, two over 5 years old, two under 2 years old.
   The older two have BSE; the younger two do not.
   Select two (i.e., both) younger cows.
   \(P(\mbox{at least one has BSE}) = 0 \).
   This situation is closest to that of Canada: animals born substantially after the feed ban
   are very unlikely to be infected, and only those will be imported (because only those are under 30
   months old, under the proposed regulations).

<h2>Some comparisons</h2>

<p>
   217 total cases worldwide, 1996&ndash;2009, according to CDC:
</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/vcjd/factsheet_nvcjd.htm">
   Since variant CJD was first reported in 1996, a total of 217 patients with this disease from 11
   countries have been identified. As of October 2009, variant CJD cases have been
   reported from the following countries: 170 from the United Kingdom, 25 from France,
   5 from Spain, 4 from Ireland, 3 from the United States, 3 in the Netherlands,
   2 in Portugal, 2 in Italy, and one each from Canada, Japan, and Saudi Arabia.
   Two of the three U.S. cases, two of the four cases from Ireland and the single
   cases from Canada and Japan were likely exposed to the BSE agent while residing
   in the United Kingdom.
   One of the 25 French cases may also have been infected in the United Kingdom.

</blockquote>

<p>
   There was another case in Canada in 2011, apparently contracted elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
  The CDC estimates that annually about 3,000 people in the U.S. die from foodborne illnesses.
  <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/index.html">http://www.cdc.gov/foodborneburden/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>
   Total infected cattle found in Canada through 2012: 19, of which 2 were identified as H-Type BSE.
   Total in the U.S. through 2012: 4, of which at least 3 were identified to be H-Type BSE.
   Total in the U.K. through 2010: 184,500 in more than 35,000 herds.
   At the peak in early 1993, there were over 1,000 new cases per week in the U.K.
   <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/bse/">http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/bse/</a>
</p>

<h2>Surveillance</h2>

<p>
   U.S. tests 40,000 cattle per year.
   Suppose the tests were of randomly selected cattle (every animal equally likely to be selected).
   Suppose all the tests are negative.
   What can we say about the prevalence of BSE in the U.S. herd?
   40,000 is a tiny fraction of cattle&mdash;is it too few?
</p>

<p>
   If the prevalence were 1%, what would the chance of at least one positive test result be?
</p>

<p class="math">
   \(P(\mbox{at least one positive}) = 100\% - P(\mbox{all negative}) = 100\% - (99\%)^{40,000} \approx 100\%. \)
</p>

<p>
   Even if the prevalence were 0.01% (one in ten thousand), the chance of at least one positive test would be
</p>

<p class="math">
   \(100\% - (99.99\%)^{40,000} \approx 98.2\%.\)
