Part of the argument in the R-CALF BSE case is over whether a risk analysis must end up with a number.
Dr. Cox argued that it must, and presented a number.
I argued that it need not, especially when coming up with a number requires unreasonable assumptions;
and I pointed out that his assumptions were unreasonable: his calculations amount to assuming that
every time an animal is to be imported, a coin is tossed.  If the coin lands heads, the animal is
infected with BSE; if the coin lands tails, the animal is healthy. For every animal, the chance
the coin lands heads is the same, and all the tosses are independent.

In your own words, explain why this is not realistic.

We've seen in lecture that probabilities give rise to rates, but that to turn rates into
probabilities requires knowing (or assuming) that some stochastic mechanism is behind the
data&mdash;for instance, coin tosses.  I've argued that Dr. Cox's
