Part of the argument in the R-CALF BSE case is over whether an analysis of risk must be
quantitative&mdash;end up with a number&mdash;to be a sound basis for decisions.
Dr. Cox argued that risk analyses must be quantitative to be reasonable, and came up
with probabilities for various things, such as the chance that at least one BSE-infected
animal would be imported each year and the chance that at least one person would be infected
by vCJD each year as a result.

I argued that risk analyses can be scientifically sound and provide a good basis for
decisions without necessarily producing any numbers.  Moreover, I argued that this is more
reasonable than producing a number when producing a number would require unreasonable assumptions.
I pointed out that Dr. Cox's assumptions were unreasonable: his calculations amount to
assuming that every time an animal is to be imported, a coin is tossed.  If the coin lands
heads, a BSE-infected animal is imported; if the coin lands tails, a BSE-free animal is
imported. Every time an animal is imported, the same coin is tossed (the chance of heads
is the same), and all the tosses are independent.

In your own words, explain why it is unreasonable to assume that the coin has the same
chance of heads for every animal.

In your own words, explain why it is unreasonable to assume that the tosses of the coin
are independent.

In your own words, explain why it is unreasonable to assume that whether an individual
imported animal is infected with BSE is like a coin toss.

We've seen in lecture that probabilities give rise to rates, but that to turn rates into
probabilities requires knowing&mdash;or assuming&mdash;that some stochastic (random)
mechanism is behind the data, for instance, coin tosses, draws from a well-mixed box of
tickets, or something similar.  I've argued that Dr. Cox's supposed mechanism isn't
realistic.  Suggest a Can you think of one that makes more sense, and still gives you all you
need to calculate a probability?

A page from the Economist was circulated to the class through Piazza.  The page gives risks
of dying from various things, from meteor strikes to suicide.  Are the numbers rates, or
probabilities?  For what group of people?  Do the numbers apply to you?  Why or why not?
