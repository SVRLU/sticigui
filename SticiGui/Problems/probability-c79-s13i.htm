The California lottery can be played in many different ways,
but the simplest version (Daily 3 Straight) works like this.
When you buy a lottery ticket, you pick a three-digit number
(from 000 to 999).
The lottery then randomly draws a random three-digit number,
with all possibilities equally likely.
If they draw your random number, you win; otherwise, you lose.
In practice, the amount you win if your number comes up varies,
but for this homework let's assume that you win exactly $550
if your number appears and $0 otherwise.
What is the expected value of your winnings (in dollars), if you play once?

Alice and Bob each roll a fair, six-sided die.
If Alice's die comes up with a number higher than Bob's,
Bob loses and he gets nothing.
If Bob's number comes up higher, or if they tie, Bob wins $5 from Alice.
