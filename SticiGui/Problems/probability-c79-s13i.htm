<span class="qSpan">We talked in class about the challenges of
data loss in computer systems due to hard disk failure.
Assume that every hard disk has a
<span class="math">0.003</span> probability of failing in the
next year, and whether one hard disk fails is independent of whether
the other hard disks fail.
If I have a computer with two hard disks,
what is the probability that neither one fails in the next year?

<span class="qSpan">Back in 1987, three Berkeley researchers
came up with a method for dealing with hard disk failure (called RAID).
In its simplest form, the idea is this: buy two hard disks, and store
each file on both disks (in duplicate).
This way, if one hard disk fails, you can still get all your data;
however, if both hard disks fail, you're hosed.
What is the probability that you're hosed at some point in the next
year, i.e., that both hard disks fail in the next year?

</script>
<span class="qSpan">One disadvantage of the simple RAID scheme
mentioned above is that, if I have 1 Terabyte of data, I need to buy
two 1 Terabyte hard disks (double the storage), which costs me twice as
much as no redundancy.
So, the Berkeley researchers came up with a more clever scheme, which has
the following property: if I have 1 Terabyte of data, I need to buy
three 0.5 Terabyte hard disks (a total of 1.5 Terabytes of storage,
so the cost of reliability is only 1.5x, not 2x).
The good news is that if any one hard disk fails, all your data
remains accessible.
However, if 2 or more hard disks fail, you are hosed.
What is the probability that you're hosed at some point in the next
year, i.e., that 2 or more of the 3 hard disks fail in the next year?
(Assume, as before, that each hard disk has a
<span class="math">0.003</span> probability of failing in the
next year, and hard disk failures occur independently.)

The California lottery can be played in many different ways,
but the simplest version (Daily 3 Straight) works like this.
When you buy a lottery ticket, you pick a three-digit number
(from 000 to 999).
The lottery then randomly draws a random three-digit number,
with all possibilities equally likely.
If they draw your random number, you win; otherwise, you lose.
In practice, the amount you win if your number comes up varies,
but for this homework let's assume that you win exactly $550
if your number appears and $0 otherwise.
What is the expected value of your winnings (in dollars), if you play once?

Here's a game.
Alice and Bob each roll a fair, six-sided die.
If Alice's die comes up with a number higher than Bob's,
Bob loses and he gets nothing.
If Bob's number comes up higher, or if they tie, Bob wins $5 from Alice.
What is the expected value of Bob's winnings,
