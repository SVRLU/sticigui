	General Instructions for Assignments
</H2>

<p>Your browser must be configured to accept cookies, to allow
pop-up windows and to use JavaScript and Java.
Generally, it is a good idea to set up your browser
to verify each document every time it is loaded, rather than to use a
cached copy.
That will ensure that you have the most up-to-date
version of every assignment.
</p>
<p>SticiGui assignments combine forms, instructions, and interactive
tools to reinforce the material presented in the chapters and to
assess your understanding. The assignments use two <EM>frames</EM>.
The upper frame has the instructions and a form for your responses;
the bottom frame has tools you might need to solve the problems, such
as graphs, calculators, <EM>etc</EM>.
</p>
<p>To access the assignments, you must provide the following
identifying information:
</p>
<p class="center">
    last name, first name, student ID, email address.
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the instruction frame, after all the questions,
there are three buttons: one to submit the assignment for grading,
one to save your intermediate results on your computer, and one to
clear the answer form.
</p>
<p class="center"><strong>You must click the submit button to send your
answers to be graded.</strong>
</p>
<p class="center"><strong>After you click the submit button, you must
click another button to confirm that you <em>really</em> want to submit
your answers for grading. </strong>
</p>
<p>
You will get confirmation in this window of your browser that your
assignment was received by the server (a message from AutoGrader).
Your score will be posted to the web.
</p>
<p><strong>After the due date, there will be no &quot;submit&quot;
button.</strong> If the submit button is missing, but the assignment
is not yet due, the clock on your computer is set incorrectly.
</p>
<p><a href="#gradeQuery" target="_self">To see your grades</A>, you
need to enter your name, email address and SID, to protect your
privacy. Click the button just under the assignment list, near the
top of this page. Also, if you go back to the assignment after the
due date, you can see the correct answers to your unique version of
the assignment.
</p>
<p>You can save intermediate results on the assignment using a button
at the bottom of the instruction page. The assignments also save
themselves on your computer when you submit them, if you have your
browser configured to accept cookies. That lets you resubmit the same
answers again in case, for some reason, your submission does not get
to the server, and lets you see your answers with the correct answers
conveniently, after the due date. <strong>Note: cookies are not very
reliable. Some things will cause or require your cookies to be
deleted. To use the save feature, you must use the same computer
every time you work on a given assignment.</strong> You can use
different computers for different assignments. After filling out the
identifying information at the top of this page to access the
assignments, the computer will look for a record of your previous
work on the assignment <strong>on the computer you are using</strong>.
If it finds your previous work, the assignment will have your
previous answers filled in. If it does not find your previous work,
the answer fields will be blank. Many of the questions and data in
assignments are generated randomly. Different students get different
questions and different data. You are scored based on the questions
and data you receive.
</p>
<p><strong>Questions with multiple-choice answers.</strong> There are
two types of questions with multiple-choice answers. The first kind
allows you to select only one response. The second kind asks you to
&quot;select all that apply.&quot; How to select more than one answer
depends on the computer operating system and browser. In Netscape and
Firefox on unix systems, click each answer you want to select;
clicking an answer again de-selects it. On Windows systems, hold down
the control (ctrl) key while clicking each response to select more
than one. On Macintosh systems, hold down the &quot;command&quot; key
to select multiple responses. In such &quot;multiple-multiple-choice&quot;
questions, if you select an answer that is not correct, or fail to
select one that is correct, you will not receive credit&mdash;there is no
partial credit.
</p>
<p><strong>Numerical answers.</strong> The grader strips commas from
numbers, so you are free to punctuate numerical responses. If your
response includes a percent sign at the end, your numerical answer
will be converted to a percentage (divided by 100). Scientific
notation (e.g., 4.23e-7 as shorthand for 0.000000423) will work; do
not put a space between the digits and the letter &quot;e.&quot;
Questions that do not have an exact numerical answer accept a small
range of answers as correct. The precision required depends on the
problem statement. When in doubt, don't round off your final answer.
In this class, there is no such thing as an answer that is &quot;too
precise.&quot; <EM>Never round off intermediate calculations</EM>.

<h2>
	<a id="troubleshooting" title="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
</h2>

<p>
	Most technical problems with the online book and assignments
	have one of three causes:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Using a browser that is not supported, or that is not configured
		correctly.
		See <a href="../minimum.htm"
		     title="minimum requirements to run SticiGui" target="_new">minimum system
		     requirements to run SticiGui</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Scrolling before the page is fully loaded.
		Be sure to wait until the page has loaded completely before you
		scroll down.
	</li>
	<li>
		Corrupted cookies.
		See <a href="#cookies" title="clearing cookies">instructions for clearing
		cookies</a>.
	</li>
</ol>

<div class="indent">
<h3>
	<a id="cookies" title="clearing cookies"></a>
	Clearing Cookies
</h3>

<p class="inline">
   Cookies are small text files stored on your computer. SticiGui
   uses cookies to store your answers to assignments and to remember
   your student ID when you log in to do an assignment or check your
   scores.
</p>
</div>

<p>
   Some browsers do not digest cookies very well (Microsoft Internet
   Explorer has more trouble than Opera, Mozilla and Firefox, in my
   experience).
   You might get an error message that you need to clear
   the cookies in your browser. When you delete the cookies, your stored
   assignment answers will be erased, but the server will still retain
   your submitted answers and your scores---only the local record on
   your computer is affected. 
   Current browsers allow you to delete cookies easily, but the command is in
   different menus in different browsers.
