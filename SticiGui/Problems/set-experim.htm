    The Method of Comparison, Experiments, and Observational Studies
</h2>

<p>
    The next few questions refer to a research article by W.J. Spangler, B.S., G.R. Cosgrove,
    M.D., H.T. Ballantine Jr., M.D., E.H. Cassem, M.D., S.L. Rauch, M.D., A. Nierenberg, M.D.,
    and B.H. Price, M.D., 1996. Magnetic Resonance Image-guided Cingulotomy for Intractable
    Psychiatric Disease, <em>Neurosurgery</em>, <em>38</em>, 1071-1078.
    The article reports on 34
    patients who underwent MRI-guided cingulotomies to treat refractory psychiatric disease at
    Massachusetts General Hospital between May, 1991, and February, 1995.
</p>

<p>
    The 34 patients, 18 male, 16 female, ages 16-71, mean age 37, had all been referred by
    their treating psychiatrists and reviewed by the MGH Cingulotomy Assessment Committee
    (comprised principally of a subset of the authors) to become candidates for the procedure.
    The committee had to agree unanimously that the patient should undergo the procedure, and
    the patient had to give his or her informed consent. Prerequisites for the committee to
    favor treatment included patient's resistance to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, behavior
    therapy, and electro-convulsive therapy (when applicable), and the symptoms had to be
    severe and unremitting for at least one year. All patients had a documented DSM III-R
    disease that interfered significantly with normal functioning (<i>e.g</i>., major
    affective disorder with unipolar depression (10 patients), or bipolar depression (5
    patients), undiagnosible developmental disorders (1 patient), and obsessive-compulsive
    disorder with major depression (15 patients)). For some patients whose condition failed to
    improve 6 months after surgery, additional cingulotomies were performed.
</p>

<p>
    The
    cingulotomy procedure is to insert a pair of electrodes into holes drilled in the skull
    just above the hairline, to a pre-determined position in the brain (guided by MRI).
    Radio-frequency electricity is passed through the electrodes, to raise the temperature in
    the part of the brain between the electrodes to 85°C (185°F) for 90 seconds, essentially
    cooking part of the brain between them. (This causes what is called a radio-frequency
    thermocoagulation lesion). The basic procedure was changed in 1993 to include a larger
    part of the brain.
</p>

<p>
    Of the 34 subjects, 31 were available for follow-up assessment of some sort; of the 31,
    two had committed suicide. Follow-up assessment was done two ways: either the referring
    psychiatrist or the treating psychiatrist completed two questionnaires---the Clinical
    Global Improvement Scale, and the Current, Global, Psychiatric-Social Status Scale---or,
    if the patient was no longer seeing a psychiatrist, the most recent correspondence with
    the patient was used to assign ratings. I could not find a reference to the number of
    patients who were in each of these categories. On the basis of these ratings, each patient
    was classified as a &quot;responder&quot; (R), a &quot;possible responder&quot; (P), or a
    &quot;non-responder&quot; (N).
</p>

<p>
    Fourteen of the patients who had not responded six months after the initial procedure
    underwent multiple procedures. The categorized responses were as follows:
</p>

<p><b>Problem A. Therapy for Smoking Cessation</b>

<p>
    This problem refers to an article by RD Hurt, LC Dale, PA Fredrickson,
    CC Caldwell, GA Lee, KP Offord, GG Lauger, Z Marusic, LW Neese, and TG
    Lundberg, 1994, &quot;Nicotine patch therapy for smoking cessation combined
    with physician advice and nurse follow-up,&quot; <i>Journal of the American
    Medical Association</i>, v. 271, 595-600.
</p>

<p>
    There is no longer any doubt that smoking cigarettes is hazardous to
    your health and the health of those around you.
    Therefore, with the accumulating
    evidence that smoking is bad for you, millions of people have either quit
    smoking or are trying to quit.
    Yet despite the many efforts that some people
    make to quit, it is often very difficult for those addicted to smoking.
    Nicotine patches are one popular form of medication prescribed by doctors
    to help people quit smoking. One of the objectives of the study by Hurt
    <i>et al.</i> was to determine the efficacy of a 22-mg nicotine patch combined
    with the National Cancer Institute program for physician advice and nurse
    follow-up in 1-year cessation outcome.
</p>

<p>
    Subjects were randomly selected from among volunteers who responded
    to a news release in the local media. 240 of those selected passed the
    physical and psychological screening and were included in the study. Subjects
    had to be between ages 20 and 65, ahve a history of smoking at least 20
    cigarettes per day for the last year, have expired carbon monoxide levels
    of 10ppm or greater, be motivated to stop smoking, be in &quot;good health&quot;
    according to a doctor's examination, have no non-nicotine chemical dependencies,
    and use no other forms of nicotine besides cigarettes.
    Subjects were randomly
    assigned either to recieve an active nicotine patch combined with physician
    advice and nurse follow-up or to receive an inactive (placebo) patch combined
    with physician advice and nurse follow-up; 120 in each group.
    Patch therapy was completed at the end of 8 weeks.
    The nurse follow-up was face-to-face
    once a week during the patch phase, and a weekly phone call for the remainder
    of the study.
    Neither the subjects nor the doctors and nurses knew who
    had been assigned to which groups.
</p>

<p>
    Smoking cessation was defined as self-reported abstinance (not even
    a puff) since the last visit and an expired air carbon monoxide level of
    8ppm or less.
    Subjects with missing information or who dropped out of the
    study for any reason were considered smokers.
    For the first 8 weeks, this represented weekly point prevalence, and
    for 3, 6, 9, and
    12 months this represented 3-month point prevalence.
</p>

<p>
    Some of the baseline characteristics (i.e., characteristics after random
    assignment, but before the stop-smoking date) are shown in the following
    table.

<b>Problem B. A Case Study on Cholera</b>

<p><i>Reading</i>:
In 1853-54 the
<a HREF="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/resources/ngo/education/ideas912/912choleraho1.html">cholera</a>
epidemic in London, England, claimed the lives of more than 500 people
- all from the Soho section of London - within a 10-day period.
John
Snow, a local physician, had been studying cholera and believed that
the disease was being spread through food or water.
Link to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
<a HREF="http://www.state.de.us/govern/agencies/dhss/irm/dph/hmpc/snow1.htm">(CDC)
web page on Snow </a>and read the background to his investigation on the
cause and transmission of cholera.

<p>
To aid his investigation on his theory that cholera was waterborne,
Snow made
<a HREF="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/resources/ngo/education/ideas912/912choleraho2.html">a
map of every death</a> in the Soho district.
For every death he determined
the water company that was serving the deceased individual. Snow found
that those being served by the Southwark and Vauxhall company had a higher
death rate than those served by the Lambeth company.
This was very suggestive evidence of cholera being waterborne.

<p>
Now link to Snow's
<a HREF="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/resources/ngo/education/ideas912/912choleraho3.html">map
showing deaths and locations of water pumps</a>.
There you can see that
most of the deaths were clustered around the water pump at Broad Street
and Lexington Street.
As told in the CDC article, once the handle to this
water pump was removed the epidemic was contained.
However, this was not
the end of the story, for it seemed that the number of deaths per day due
to cholera was dropping anyway.
According to John Snow:
</p>

<p>
<blockquote><small>
    Although the
    above facts shown in the table above afford very strong evidence of the
    powerful influence which the drinking of water containing the sewage of
    a town exerts over the spread of cholera, when that disease is present,
    yet the question does not end here; for the intermixing of the water supply
    of the Southwark and Vauxhall Company with that of the Lambeth Company,
    over an extensive part of London, admitted of the subject being sifted
    in such a way as to yield the most incontrovertible proof on one side or
    the other.
    In the subdistricts enumerated in the above table as being supplied
    by both Companies, the mixing of the supply is of the most intimate kind.
    The pipes of each company go down all the streets, and into nearly all
    the courts and alleys.
    A few houses are supplied by one Company and a few
    by the other, according to the decision of the owner or occupier at that
    time when the Water Companies were in active competition.
    In many cases
    a single house has a supply different from that on the either side.
    Each
    Company supplies both rich and poor, both large houses and small; there
    is no difference either in the condition or occupation of the persons receiving
    the waters of the different Companies.
    </small>
</p>

<p>
    <small>Now it must be evident
    that, if the dimunition of cholera in the districts partly supplied with
    improved water, depended on this supply, the houses receiving it would
    be the houses enjoying the whole benefit of the dimunitions of the malady,
    whilst the houses supplied by the water from Battersea Fields would suffer
    the same mortality as they would if the improved water supply did not exist
    at all.
    As there is no difference whatever in the houses or the people
    receiving the supply of the two Water Companies, or in any of the physical
    conditions with which they are surrounded, it obvious that no experiment
    could have been devised which would more thoroughly test the effect of
    water supply on the progress of cholera than this, which circumstances
    placed ready made before the observer.</small>
