    that reports on 34 patients who received brain surgery to treat psychiatric problems.
    The 34 patients had MRI-guided cingulotomies at
    Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) between May, 1991, and February, 1995, to treat
    refractory psychiatric disease.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    The patients (18 male, 16 female, ages 16-71, mean age 37) all had been referred by
    their treating psychiatrists.
    Their cases were reviewed by the MGH Cingulotomy Assessment Committee
    (comprised principally of a subset of the authors) to become candidates for the procedure.
    The committee had to agree unanimously that the patient should undergo the procedure, and
    the patient had to give his or her informed consent.
    Prerequisites for the committee to
    favor treatment included patient's resistance to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, behavior
    therapy, and electro-convulsive therapy (when applicable), and the symptoms had to be
    severe and unremitting for at least one year.
    All patients had a documented DSM III-R
    disease that interfered significantly with normal functioning (<i>e.g.</i>., major
    affective disorder with unipolar depression (10 patients), or bipolar depression (5
    patients), undiagnosible developmental disorders (1 patient), and obsessive-compulsive
    disorder with major depression (15 patients)).
    For some patients whose condition failed to
    improve 6 months after surgery, additional cingulotomies were performed.
</p>

<p>
    The cingulotomy procedure is to insert a pair of electrodes into holes drilled in the skull
    just above the hairline, to a pre-determined position in the brain (guided by MRI).
    Radio-frequency electricity is passed through the electrodes, to raise the temperature in
    the part of the brain between the electrodes to 85&deg;C
    (185&deg;F) for 90 seconds, essentially cooking part of the brain between the
    electrodes.
    (This causes what is called a radio-frequency thermocoagulation lesion).
    The basic procedure was changed in 1993 to include a larger
    part of the brain.
</p>

<p>
    Of the 34 subjects, 31 were available for follow-up assessment of some sort; of the 31,
    two had committed suicide. Follow-up assessment was done two ways: either the referring
    psychiatrist or the treating psychiatrist completed two questionnaires---the Clinical
    Global Improvement Scale, and the Current, Global, Psychiatric-Social Status Scale---or,
    if the patient was no longer seeing a psychiatrist, the most recent correspondence with
    the patient was used to assign ratings. I could not find a reference to the number of
    patients who were in each of these categories. On the basis of these ratings, each patient
    was classified as a &quot;responder&quot; (R), a &quot;possible responder&quot; (P), or a
    &quot;non-responder&quot; (N).
</p>

<p>
    Fourteen of the patients who had not responded six months after the initial procedure
    had multiple procedures.
    The categorized responses were as follows:

<h3>
    Alcohol and Heart Disease

    The next few questions refer to an hypothetical study of alcohol and heart disease.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    I wish to study the effect of daily consumption of small amounts of
    alcohol (say, two glasses of wine) on the incidence of heart disease.
    In many European countries, it is customary to drink wine with dinner,
    while in most Islamic countries, it is not.
    I therefore decide to compare
    the average incidence of heart disease for several European countries in
    which the average daily consumption of wine is two glasses, with the
    incidence of heart disease in Saudi Arabia, where the consumption of
    alcohol is negligible (it is a capital offense).
    Consider the non-drinkers
    to be the control group, and the drinkers to be the treatment group.
    Suppose it turns out that the
    incidence of heart disease is lower in Saudi Arabia.

    that studies the effectiveness of nicotine patches for quitting smoking.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    It is well known that smoking cigarettes is bad for you.
    Many smokers try to quit, but quitting can be very difficult.
    Nicotine patches are a popular medication prescribed by doctors
    to help people quit smoking.
    One of the objectives of the study described here was to determine how effective
    a nicotine patch, combined with the National Cancer Institute program for
    physician advice and nurse follow-up, is in helping people &quot;stay quit&quot;
    for a year.
</p>

<div class="indent">
<p class="inline">
    The experimenters solicited volunteers; subjects were selected randomly
    from the volunteers and screened physically and psychologically.
    To be eligible for the study, a subject had to be between 20 and 65 years old,
    had to have smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day for the last year,
    had to have expired carbon monoxide (CO) levels
    of 10 parts per million (10&nbsp;ppm) or more,

    according to a doctor's examination (including blood chemistry, blood cell count,
    cholesterol and triglyceride levels, urinalysis, and an electrocardiogram;
    medical history was also checked to make sure that subjects did not have a
    history of heart trouble or take medications that might have made the patch
    inadvisable), could not have psychiatric disorder, could have no chemical
    dependencies other than nicotine,
    could not consume nicotine in any form other than cigarettes, and could not have
    participated in previous nicotine patch studies.
    The researchers enrolled 240 subjects after the screening.
</p>
</div>

<p>
    Those subjects were assigned at random either to receive a 22&nbsp;mg nicotine patch
    (and physician's advice and nurse follow-up) --- the treatment group ---
    or to receive a placebo patch
    (and physician's advice and nurse follow-up) --- the control group.
    One hundred twenty subjects were assigned to treatment and 120 were assigned to control.
    Subjects wore patches for 8 weeks.
</p>

<p>
    Nurse follow up was weekly, face-to-face for the first 8 weeks and by phone
    thereafter.
    Neither the subjects, the doctors, nor the nurses, knew which subjects
    wore active patches and which wore placebo patches.
</p>

<p>
    The study classified a subject as having quit smoking if:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        the subject reported that he or she had not smoked <em>at all</em>
        since the last visit, and
    </li>
    <li>
        the level of CO in the subject's expired air was 8&nbsp;ppm or less.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Subjects with missing information or who dropped out of the
    study for any reason were considered smokers.

    In the first eight weeks, 44 subjects dropped out of the study,
    19 from the treatment group and 25 from the control group.
    Some dropped out because of adverse reactions to the patch (6 treatment, 0 control)
    or adverse events related the patch (1 treatment, 3 control).
    Twenty-four of the subjects (9 treatment, 13 control) did not comply with the
    visit requirements, and were dropped from the study; one treated subject was
    dropped because she got pregnant; and one control subject was dropped for using
    nicotine gum.
    I could not find information in the paper on the drop out rates after the eighth week
    (the patch phase of the study).
