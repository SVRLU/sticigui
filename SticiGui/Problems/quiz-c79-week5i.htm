        Part of the argument in the R-CALF BSE case is over whether an analysis of risk must be
        quantitative&mdash;end up with a number&mdash;to be a sound basis for decisions.
        Dr. Cox argued that risk analyses must be quantitative to be reasonable, and came up
        with probabilities for various things, such as the chance that at least one BSE-infected
        animal would be imported each year and the chance that at least one person would be infected
        by vCJD each year as a result.
</p>
<p>
        Prof. Stark argued that risk analyses can be scientifically sound and provide a good basis for
        decisions without necessarily producing any numbers.  Moreover, Stark argued that this is more
        reasonable than producing a number when producing a number would require unreasonable assumptions.
        Prof. Stark claimed that Dr. Cox's assumptions were unreasonable: Dr. Cox's calculations amount to
        assuming that every time an animal is to be imported, a coin is tossed.  If the coin lands
        heads, a BSE-infected animal is imported; if the coin lands tails, a BSE-free animal is
        imported. Every time an animal is imported, the same coin is tossed (the chance of heads
        is the same), and all the tosses are independent.
